On seeing the illustrious Lakshmana who entered unimpededly and infuriately,
Sugreeva became one with agitated senses. [4-34-1]

On seeing Lakshmana, the son of Dasharatha, who is exasperated and exhaling heavily,
and who searing in the anguish of his brother is flaring up like a firestorm, Sugreeva hopped up
from his golden seat and tottered like the highly decorated flagstaff of Indra, which will be
wobbly before it is thrown to ground after the ritual. [4-34-2, 3]

While Sugreeva is jumping up stumblingly, stumbled with him are Ruma and the other
females in tow, who are so far clinging to him, like the clusters of stars that spring up on the
emergence of full moon in sky. [4-34-4]

That fortunate Sugreeva whose eyes are bloodshot with drinking flurried towards
Lakshmana adjoining palms in supplication, and became standstill at his nearby, like a lofty
<font color="#B3003A">kalpa vriksha</font> wish-fulfilling tree. [4-34-5]

Infuriate Lakshmana spoke to Sugreeva who like the star clustered moon is standing
with his wife Ruma at his side amid other vanara females. [4-34-6]

"One who is dynamic, abounding with best troopers, sympathetic, senses conquered, a
faithful one and an advocate of truth, he alone thrives as a king in the world. [4-34-7]

"He who is enthroned as a king but anchored himself to dishonesty and makes fake
assurances to helpful friends, who can be more ruthless than him? [4-34-8]

"A person gets attached to the sin of killing of a hundred of his manes, deified
souls of his own ancestors, if he promises to gift one horse but fails to do so, and in promising
to gift one cow but failing in it he gets the sin of killing a thousand manes, and if he promises
to a person to do the needful help and fails in rendering that help, then he gets the sin of
suicide along with the sin of killing his own kith and kin. [4-34-9]

"He who gets his means fulfilled earlier through his friends but does not requite
them, oh, king of monkeys, such a treacherous one is eliminable for all beings. [4-34-10]

"On seeing such perfidious soul, oh, fly-jumper, Brahma irefully declared this verse
which is reverenced by all the worlds, you too may know it. [4-34-11]

" 'The savants have ordained atonement for slayers of cows, for drinkers of liquors,
thus for thieves and infringers of solemnity, but no atonement is available to a treacherous
person. [4-34-12]

"Oh, Vanara, firstly you have got your purpose fulfilled and by that reason you are
not reciprocating help to Rama, thereby you are an uncultured and unfriendly one, and illusive is
your word of honour. [4-34-13]

"Oh, Vanara, you achieved your means through Rama, and Rama is wishing for his
endeavour through you, and I wonder whether the search for Seetha is not your duty? [4-34-14]

"An illusive promisor basking in churlish pleasures, such as you are, Rama has not
realised that you are a serpent with the croaking of a frog. [4-34-15]

"By the highly prudent and compassionate Rama, you the sinner got the kingdom of
monkeys, and it is a gain of an evil-soul from a noble-soul. [4-34-16]

"If you do not recognise what the noble-souled Raghava has done to you, you will be
instantly killed with incisive arrows enabling you to see Vali. [4-34-17]

"Oh, Sugreeva, abide by your commitment. The path by which slain Vali has gone that
path is not tapered off, as such do not tread Vali's path. [4-34-18]

"Definitely you are not envisaging the Thunderbolt similar arrows from the bow of
the best one from Ikshvaku dynasty, Rama, thereby you are enjoying luxuries joyously without giving
a thought to Rama's mission even at your heart. [4-34-19]

They all on quickly going to Kishkindha, the city of Vali, hedged themselves in the
thickets of forest trees and waited. [4-14-1]

That forest lover with tumultuous voice Sugreeva cast his eye everywhere and assumed
tremendous fury. [4-14-2]

Then Sugreeva encompassed by his followers war-whooped ghastlily, like a great cloud
that emerged accelerated by gusty wind and that is thundering as though to rip the sky, inviting
Vali for fight. [4-14-3]

Then Sugreeva who is like the rising sun and whose stride is like that of a proud
lion saw the adroit Rama and then said this sentence. [4-14-4b, 5a]

" She whose arch-way is decorated in gold, who is spread out with snares of monkeys,
and who is impregnated with flags and machinery, we arrived at such city of Vali, Kishkindha.
[4-14-5b, 6a]

"Oh Brave one, you make happen the promise you earlier made regarding the
elimination of Vali on time, like the time of sprouting that enables a creeper-plant to bear a
sprout on time. [4-14-6b, 7a]

When thus said by Sugreeva that enemy-destroyer and righteous Raghava said this word
Sugreeva. [4-14-7b, 8a]

"By which creeper-garland that Lakshmana plucked out and garlanded you, by this
creeper-garland of gaja-flowers alone your identification is marked. [4-14-8b, 9a]

"Oh brave-one, you are shining forth with this creeper-garland laced at your neck
like the night time sun with a garland of stars. [4-14-9b, 10a]

"Oh Vanara, today itself I will set you free from the fear and enmity whipped up by
Vali by releasing a single arrow in fight. [4-14-10b, 11a]

"You show me your enemy in a brother's mien, oh, monkey, by then he will be rolling
in the dust of this forest eliminated by me. [4-14-11b, 12a]

"If he returns to live even after my espying him then immediately you can find fault
with me, you can even deride me. [4-14-12b, 13a]

"Seven saala trees are rived with a single of arrow of mine in your presence,
thereby be sure that Vali will be dispatched now, by my might. [4-14-13b, 14a]

"Just bound by the anxiousness to implement righteousness untruth is unsaid by me
earlier though I am involved in distresses for a long time, and hereafter it will not be said in
anywise. [4-14-14b, 15a]

"As Indra fructifies the sprouted paddy field I will make happen my promise, hence
leave off your perplexity." [4-14-15b, 16a]

"Thereby to invite that Vali with golden pendant, oh, Sugreeva, you make such a
war-cry by which that monkey Vali comes out. [4-14-16b, 17a]

"Vali is a willing fighter who shines forth by his victories and one who is given
ovation for his triumphs, and undefeated by you as yet, such as he is he may be incited with
war-whoop so that he comes out without any hindrance. [4-14-17b, 18a]

"One who is assertive of his own valour will not tolerate to hear enemy's daring in
a brawl, that too in the presence of ladies." So said Rama to Sugreeva. [4-14-18b, 19a]

On hearing the words of Rama he that Sugreeva with golden yellow complexion blared a
gruesome blare as though to completely rend the sky. [4-14-19b, 20a]

By that sound of Sugreeva the splendour of cows is marred and they are running
helter-skelter like the well-born ladies who are mishandled by invaders due to the misrule of their
own king. [4-14-20b, 21a]

And deer are hurriedly fleeing like war worsted horses, and the sky-flying birds are
falling to ground like planets or stars when their merit diminishes. [4-14-21b, c]

Sugreeva, the son of Sun, who is well-known for cloud like thundering, and whose
vigour is now reinforced by his bravery, then promptly released an oceanic roar like an ocean with
splashing waves drifted by gales. [4-14-22]

On hearing the words of Angada along with those of his ministers, namely Hanuma, Plaksha, and Prabhava et al, 
also on knowing that Lakshmana is angered, that sensible Sugreeva stirred from seat. [4-32-1]

On discriminating the pros and cons Sugreeva spoke this sentence to the strategist-ministers, for he himself is 
an expert in strategies and a diligent one in carrying out those strategies. [4-32-2]

"I have not in the least spoken any ill of them, nor committed any misdeed in their respect, thus I am thinking 
why should Raghava's brother Lakshmana take offence at me? [4-32-3]

"Unsympathetic rivals of mine, who will always be snoopy for scope, might have ear-filled Raghava's brother about 
the fabricated faults of mine. [4-32-4]

"In this situation, all of you on your part and according to your perspectives have to find out firstly and meticulously 
about the attitude of Lakshmana, along with a steady but diligent determination thereof. [4-32-5]

"Definitely there is no fear for me from Lakshmana, not even from Raghava, but an unfounded ire of a friend alone 
is giving rise to disquiet. [4-32-6]

"It is always practicable to befriend any, but in turn it is impracticable to manage that friendship, even a trifle 
splits off that friendliness for sentiments are transient. [4-32-7]

"On that score I am flustering because of the noble-souled Rama, and I cannot possibly requite the favour that 
has been done to me." So said Sugreeva to his ministers. [4-32-8]

While Sugreeva is saying that way, the eminent-monkey Hanuma spoke with a dint of his own expediency, from among 
the Vanara ministers. [4-32-9]

"In any case, it is not astonishing to say, oh, king of monkey troops, that you with a deep regard have not forgotten 
the advantageous help rendered to you, since it is natural for you. [4-32-10]

"On his part Raghava tossed off his fear distantly and eliminated Vali, whose valour equals that of Indra, only 
to fulfil your cherish. [4-32-11]

"Anywise, by virtue of his friendliness with you Raghava must be annoyed, hence he must have expedited his brother 
Lakshmana, whose disposition in effect to is enhance prosperity. [4-32-12]

"You have become ecstatic, oh, the best of the best timekeepers, hence you are unaware of the slippage of time, 
but the sedate and dark-green autumn on its part is underway unfolding dark-green leaves canopying seven-leaved 
banana plants. [4-32-13]

"Clear is the sky with its planets and stars as clouds have vanished on it, even all the ten directions are clear, 
and the rivers and lakes too are equable. [4-32-14]

"Because the time for campaigns has chanced, oh, the ablest monkey, and because you were very slumberous you have 
not got the drift of it, as such Lakshmana must have come here, and it is obvious. [4-32-15]

"Raghava's bitter words are endurable by you as he is primarily an anguished person, further he is the one whose 
is wife is abducted, and furthermore he is magnanimous in giving kingdom to you, besides, he is reproachful through 
another person, namely Lakshmana. [4-32-16]

"Indeed, I do not foresee any other appropriate means for you, as a blunder is committed by you, other than seeking 
Lakshmana's pardon duly adjoining your palms. [4-32-17]

"A king is to be advised beneficially and unhesitatingly by the minister designates, that is why I am speaking 
what I hold fast discarding fear. [4-32-18]

"If Raghava is highly infuriated he is capable to keep the world under his control along with gods, demons, gandharva-s 
just on hitching up his bow, isn't it! [4-32-19]

"It becomes unseemly to infuriate him who is to be placated time and again, especially when remembering his earlier 
beneficence to you and when you are beholden to him. [4-32-20]

"Prostrate yourself before him along with your son, friends and relatives to pay deference, oh, king, and abide 
by your own accord you made with him remaining under his auspices, like a wife abiding in the care of her husband. 
[4-32-21]

"It will be unseemly to fend off the ruling of Rama, or of his brother Lakshmana even in your imagination, oh, 
king of monkeys, as your heart is aware of the humanly tenacity of that Rama, whose resplendence vies with that 
of Indra, and who is associated with selfsame Lakshmana, isn't it." Thus Hanuma spoke to Sugreeva. [4-32-22]

In that way when Tara has submissively argued with words containing probity,
Saumitri gave assent to her perspective as he is soft by his nature. [4-36-1]

And when Lakshmana conceded to that argument of Tara, Sugreeva, the king of
monkey-troops, got rid of his highly intense scare of Lakshmana, like the riddance of a dampened
cloth. [4-36-2]

Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, then ripped apart the superb garland which is so far
enwreathing his neck, and which has several strands according several gratifications, and he also
became sober as though the insobriety is ripped from his mind. [4-36-3]

Sugreeva who is the most powerful one among all vanara-s, then placatingly spoke
this humble sentence to Lakshmana, whose prowess is most formidable. [4-36-4]

"My prosperity, prominence and this perpetual kingdom of monkeys are once mislaid,
but oh, Soumitri, I regained all this just by the beneficence of Rama. [4-36-5]

"Who is capable of requiting Rama, oh, prince Lakshmana, even by a fraction of that
kind of inestimable help taken from him, as that lord is renowned by actions particular to himself,
like daring and eliminating Vali.

"Who is capable of repudiating such a lordly Rama, even by a fraction of one's own
bravery, unless he is prepared to tread that kind of path on which Vali has gone. [4-36-6]

"Virtue-souled Raghava reacquires Seetha, and even exterminates Ravana by himself
with his own resplendence, while I and my assistance remain only in name. [4-36-7]

"Basically, why some measures of succour need be extended to him who has ripped
seven gigantic-trees, a mountain, and even the earth, all just with one arrow! [4-36-8]

"He who outstretches his bow with a clangour by which the earth with its mountains
quakes, oh, Lakshmana, to him these aides are really of what aid, indeed! [4-36-9]

"Lakshmana, I just can tread behind that king of people, Rama, on his charging to
eliminate enemy Ravana along with all of his vanguards, that's all. [4-36-10]

"If I have overstepped either in faith or friendliness, in the least, that may be
pardoned for I am an attendant of yours. By the way, none is unoffending. [4-36-11]

Lakshmana is pleased with that great-souled Sugreeva who is speaking thus, and said
this he said to him, indeed, in friendliness. [4-36-12]

"In anyway, my brother indeed has a defender with him, oh, king of vanara-s
Sugreeva, especially you, who are a defender of your own word and a deferential one towards Rama.
[4-36-13]

"With this kind of preponderance and plainness you possess, Sugreeva, you are the
only merited one to enjoy this unexcelled kingdom of monkeys. [4-36-14]

"Before long, Sugreeva, dauntless Rama will be eliminating enemies in a war with you
as his supporter, there is no doubt about it. [4-36-15]

"You are the knower of virtuousness and gratefulness and you do not retreat from
battlegrounds, or, on your own word, thus what you have said is conclusive as well as coherent.
[4-36-16]

"Even though one has capability to know his own lapse and speak it up, oh, ablest
among Vanara-s, who is he that behoves outspokenly, excepting my elder brother and you.
[4-36-17]

"You are a coequal to Rama by your valour and vigour and oh, best one among monkeys,
gods have given you after a long time. [4-36-18]

"However, you quickly start from here along with me, oh, brave one, and embolden
your friend who is anguishing in the despoilment of his wife. [4-36-19]

"Oh, friend, on hearing that which querulously spoken by Rama, who is downhearted in
his anguish, I too reflexively spoke bitter-words to you, and thus whatever I spoke that may be
pardoned. [4-36-20]

"That expert in sentences, namely sage Nishaakara, entered his own dwelling on
saying these and many other words of encouragement and after permitting me to take leave.
[4-63-1]

"But on creeping slowly and slowly from the cave of that mountain I clambered up the
Mt. Vindhya and I am looking forward for your arrival... [4-63-2]

"As of now, a little more than a hundred years have slipped by, and I am awaiting
events and times minding sage's words in my heart... [4-63-3]

"But many illogical thoughts crowded round me when Sage Nishaakara has gone on great
voyage to heaven, thus my anguish burned me down... [4-63-4]

"I have been reversing the thought cropped up for my suicide by virtue of the
afflatus endowed to me by that sage, and I have been safeguarding my lives as that afflatus is
taking away my anguish, as a tongue of flaring fire takes away darkness... [4-63-5, 6a]

"Though I am aware of the valour of that dirty-minded Ravana, I was rebuking my son
saying, 'how you have not saved Maithili?' [4-63-6b, 7a]

"My son has not effectuated my cherish even on hearing the bewail of Seetha, or at
least on hearing that Rama and Lakshmana are separated from Seetha, or at least on knowing my
friendship with Dasharatha..." Thus Sampaati spoke to monkeys. [4-63-7b, 8a]

Both the wings of Sampaati have then cropped up just before the eyes of those
monkeys who are clustering around him, while Sampaati is speaking in this way to those monkeys...
[4-63-8b, 9a]

On looking at his own body which is now covered with newborn reddish-feathered wings
Sampaati obtained an incomparable rejoice, and he also said this to vanara-s. [4-63-9b, 10a]

By the efficacy of that kingly sage of illimitable magnificence both the wings of
Sampaati that were burnt down by sunrays have resurfaced again. [4-63-10b, 11a]

"Which valour, vigour, and valiance were prevailing in my youth, now I am
experiencing them alone... [4-63-11b, 12a]

"Let an endeavour be made by all of you. For sure, you will come by Seetha. This
event of my regaining wings shall be the causer of credibility in you all... [4-63-12b, 13a]

On saying thus to all of those monkeys that best bird Sampaati took wing from that
mountaintop to ascertain the plight of a sky-going bird when anew on the wing. [4-63-13b, 14a]

On hearing that word of Sampaati those tigerly monkeys are heartily gladdened and
while their valour inspiriting them they have became proactive towards their task. [4-63-14]

Those best fly-jumpers having redeemed their certitude, then with a gustily gusto
waited for an opportune time called <font color="#B3003A">abhijit lagna</font> and then journeyed
on to the southern direction, as they are the pioneers in searching Seetha, the daughter of Janaka.
[4-63-15]

On calling forth all the fly-jumpers for achieving the purpose of Rama's task the
best fly-jumper and the king of monkeys Sugreeva spoke to all of them, "oh, best vanara-s, you
shall search all of this earth as I have detailed." Sugreeva said so to all monkeys. [4-45-1,
2a]

Understanding that arduous order of the king of monkeys Sugreeva those best monkeys
started out covering the earth like grasshoppers. [4-45-2, 3a]

Rama remained on that Mt. Prasravana along with Lakshmana looking forward to that
month which is marked for locating Seetha. [4-45-3b, 4a]

Then the brave monkey Shatabali swiftly started towards the beautiful northern
quarter that is encompassed by the king of mountains, namely Himavanta. [4-45-4b, 5a]

The monkey-troop commander Vinata journeyed towards the eastern direction, and the
fly-jumper, leader of monkeys and Air-god's son Hanuma travelled towards southerly quarter that is
once trodden by Sage Agastya, along with Lt. Tara, Prince-regent Angada, and others. [4-45-5b,
6]

The commander of fly-jumpers and a tigerly monkey Sushena started out towards the
horrifying western direction that is ruled by Varuna, the Rain-god. [4-45-7]

Then on disposing the commanders of monkey army to all directions according to their
capabilities, that valorous king Sugreeva who is contented earlier by way of gaining his kingdom
through Rama, is now gladdened to his heart's content for sending monkey troops to all directions
as a requital to Rama's help. [4-45-8]

In this way when despatched by their king Sugreeva all the vanara lieutenants
expeditiously started towards one's own direction. [4-45-9]

When those great mighty fly-jumpers have started to dash off some are bawling, some
highly blaring, some more thundering, and some more oddly bellowing, while some more are roaring
like lions. [4-45-10]

Well-motivated this way by the king Sugreeva those vanara lieutenants put their
fortitude into boastful words and said, "we lead forth Seetha, we wish to kill Ravana."
[4-45-11]

"I will kill Ravana single-handedly if he chances on battlefield, and then on
drubbing the other demons I will quickly bring back Janaka's daughter, Seetha." Another monkey
soldier said so. [4-45-12]

"I alone will bring back Janaki even from netherworlds, who might be shivering owing
to enervation, and you my monkey-soldier colleagues, you all may stay behind now." Thus another
monkey-hero said. [4-45-13]

"I will completely shatter the trees, shred the mountains, split the earth and storm
the oceans." Thus another monkey gave war cry. [4-45-14]

"I can fly-jump a hundred yojana-s, undoubtedly," said one monkey while the other
said, "I can jump even more than a hundred yojana-s, for sure." [4-45-15]

"My transit cannot be thwarted either on the plane of earth, or in the ocean, or on
mountains or in forests, or in the netherworld, or in its core." This is the slogan of another
monkey-warrior. [4-45-16]

Thus each individual vanara gave war-whoops with the proper proud of his might in
the audience of monkeys king Sugreeva and departed. [4-45-17]

As commanded by the king of monkeys Sugreeva all of the elephantine monkeys essayed
everywhere with post-hast for a glimpse of Vaidehi. [4-47-1]

Those monkeys have thoroughly searched at lakes, in the pens of creepers on
riverbanks, in vacant lands and in crowded cities and at impassable places with rivers and
mountains. [4-47-2]

All the monkey commanders explicitly commanded by Sugreeva, very carefully searched all the provinces inclusive of mountains,
woodlands, and thick forests of those provinces. [4-47-3]

All the Vanara-s firmed up in finding Seetha have searched nooks and corners of
earth by day, and at nighttimes they used to come together onto earth at scheduled places.
[4-47-4]

In all those days those Vanara-s used to come to trees which have fruits of all
seasons, to make those trees as their beds at bedtime. [4-47-5]

Counting the day of their starting as day one, those elephantine monkeys returned to
Mt. Prasavana within one month, hopeless of Seetha, and met Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, who is
with Rama awaiting the return of monkeys. [4-47-6]

Cmdr. Vinata, the great-mighty vanara, came back after searching eastern quarter as
Sugreeva had advised, but without finding Seetha there. [4-47-7]

Even the valiant and matchless monkey Shatabali explored whole of the northern
direction along with his army, but he too came back as Seetha is undiscovered there. [4-47-8]

Sushena, the father-in-law of Sugreeva, searching whole of western quarter along
with vanara-s, but not finding Seetha there, he came back when one month is completed, and
approached Sugreeva. [4-47-9]

All of the expeditionists have reached and venerated Sugreeva who is sitting along
with Rama on the peak of Mt. Prasavana and spoke this to him. [4-47-10]

"All of the mountains, all of the serried forests, all of the riversides up to the
edge of oceans, likewise, all of the inhabitations have been searched. [4-47-11]

"Those caves that were explicitly extolled by you, they are all thoroughly searched,
and immense shrubby hutches that are thickly entwined with climber plants have also been rummaged.
[4-47-12]

"Search is conducted in the compacted, lopsided, and impenetrable provinces, and
colossal beings are hunted out and killed presuming that Ravana might have assumed those odd
shapes, and the impassable provinces are searched high and low, time and again. [4-47-13]

"Hanuma is high-born and exceptionally mighty, oh, Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s,
he will ascertain about Maithili, because the son of Air-god, Hanuma, resorted to the direction in
which Seetha is taken away." Thus, monkey chiefs reported to their king Sugreeva. [4-47-14]

Then on comforting all of those vanara-s the highly diligent one but overly tired
Angada slowly spoke this word to them. [4-49-1]

"We in oneness have searched there and thereabouts in the impassable forests,
mountains, and rivers, and unfathomable cavities and in mountain caves up to their end, but we have
not seen Janaki, so also that ill-natured demon, the abductor of Seetha, is not seen. [4-49-2,
3]

"We started a long time back and a great deal of time is lapsed, and Sugreeva is a
severe disciplinarian, therefore let the search continued everywhere collectively. [4-49-4]

"Surrender not to sluggishness, submit not to sorrowfulness, slouch not to sleep, as
these lethargies are presently have come up against you. Let all of you search in such a way how
best we can find the daughter of Janaka, Seetha. [4-49-5]

"Insistency, ingenuity and indomitability of heart are said to be the causes for
achieving results, therefore I am speaking all this. [4-49-6]

"Even now the forest dwellers can search this impenetrable forest, thus get rid of
your rue and let all of this forest be searched in its entirety. [4-49-7]

"Fruit of pursuit will definitely be evident for those who undertake an endeavour
earnestly, on the other hand, it will be unforgivable to shut our eyes deriving a high dejection.
[4-49-8]

"King Sugreeva is irascible and he is a ruthful persecutor too, oh, vanara-s, we
shall always be frightened of him, and of self-reliant Rama as well. [4-49-9]

"All this is being said in the interest of your well-being, and if it is obliging to
you it may be done in this way as I have said, if not, any other way out is there which will be
conducive for all of us, oh, vanara-s, it may be said." Thus Angada spoke to the troops of monkeys.
[4-49-10]

On hearing Angada's words, Gandhamaadana who is enervated with thirst and fatigue
spoke this sentence with inexplicit words. [4-49-11]

"What Angada has said that is indeed appropriate, isn't it! It is advantageous and
pragmatic also. Let us carry out as said by him. [4-49-12]

"Again let us search out mountains, caves, crags, also like that the uninhabited
forests and mountain rapids, too. [4-49-13]

"Let us all collectively search all of the places with forests, mountains and gorges
as indicated by that self-assertive Sugreeva." Thus Gandhamaadana spoke to all monkeys.
[4-49-14]

Those great-mighty vanara-s again perking themselves up searched the southern
compass that is overspread with Vindhya forests. [4-49-15]

Those vanara-s who are the best among monkeys who are desirous of getting a glance
of Seetha have clambered up a magnificent Silver Mountain which in statuesque is like an autumnal
silvery cloud, and which has many zeniths and caverns, and searched there in the delightful woods
of Lodhra trees, and even in the groves of seven-leaved banana plants. [4-49-16, 17]

Though they searched everywhere on ascending the mountaintop they have not found
Seetha, the dear queen of Rama, and though they are immensely venturesome they are fatigued.
[4-49-18]

On searching what all they could see all over on that many caved mountain those
monkeys descended yet keeping an eye on all over that mountain. [4-49-19]

Then on climbing down the mountain they reached ground and became tired and inane,
and staying there for moment they took shelter at the base of a tree. [4-49-20]

They took respite for a moment and when their laboriousness intermitted a little,
again they ventured to search the southern direction in its entirety. [4-49-21]

Again making Mt. Vindhya as the starting point of search, those best fly-jumpers,
namely Hanuma and the other chieftains of vanara-s, have searched all over the southern direction
for Seetha. [4-49-22]

Thus, Hanuma on saying therein [that subject,] again spoke to that most reverential
and sainted lady who is dressed in black deerskin and conducting herself in probity. [4-51-1]

"Overtired with hunger and thirst we are overawed anywise, and we suddenly entered
this cavity, which is overspread with darkness..." [Thus Hanuma is speaking to her.] [4-51-2]

"We entered this extensive hollow of earth thirstily, but on seeing this kind of
these diverse and marvellous mansions we are verily amazed [presuming that this is a dominion of
some demon,] and we are agitated [in not knowing dos and don'ts,] and agonised [at our
incarceration...] whose trees are all these golden ones, splendent like young sun... [4-51-3,
4]

"The edibles, tubers, and fruits are all depurated... golden are the aircrafts...
mansions silvern... ventilators golden and encased in jewelly laces... [4-51-5, 6a]

"Flowered and fruited and also aromatically scented are these auspicious and
completely golden trees... by whose splendour [they are rendered thus?] [4-51-6b, 7a]

"Also how the lotuses born in limpid water are golden, and how the fishes along with
tortoises are ostensibly golden? [4-51-7b, 8a]

"Or, is all this owing to the innate prodigy of yours or to whose ascesis' prowess
all this is owed... as all of us are oblivious of it, so it will be apt of you to narrate all of
it..." [Thus Hanuma requested that sainted lady.] [4-51-8b, 9a]

Thus when Hanuma addressed her, that sainted lady, and a blissful one in the well
being of all the beings, she replied Hanuma. [4-51-9b, 10a]

"A marvellous fantasist by name Maya was there, a bullish demon of wizardry and by
him with his phenomenal expertise all this golden woodland is constructed..." [Thus, that sainted
lady started her narration.] [4-51-10b]

"Once he was the Universal Craftsman to the lords of demons by whom this divinely
golden and superb mansion was constructed... [4-51-11]

"But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest,
obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, [which entails acquirement of] entire wealth of Sage
Shukra...

"But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest,
obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, [which entails acquirement of] entire wealth of those
people, who immoderately and avariciously beseech all the available gods, to accord all wealth to
them only...[4-51-12b, 13a]

"That dynamic one methodised everything and then resided comfortably in this great
forest for some time, privileged with all his wishes... [4-51-13b, 14a]

"Indra, the Administrator of Worlds and destroyer of enemy citadels, on taking His
Thunderbolt eliminated Maya, when that eminent demon was engaged with an apsara, a paradisiacal
nymph, called Hema... [4-51-14b, 15a]

"This marvellous woodland, these everlasting wish-fulfillers, and this golden
mansion, are beneficed by Brahma for Hema... [4-51-15]

"I am the daughter of Merusaavarni, oh, best monkey, named Swayamprabha and I am
safeguarding this mansion of her, [that apsara] Hema... [4-51-16b, 17a]

"Hema is a virtuoso in dance and music and my dearest nymphean-friend, and she
bestowed a boon upon me [by which none can dishonour me, and thus] I am safeguarding this superb
mansion... [4-51-17b, 18a]

"What is your effort or for what reason you came to pass this impervious forest, and
how you all have discovered this impassable forest... [4-51-18b, 19a]

"Dine on these wholesome edibles, fruits and tubers, also on drinking soft drinks,
it is apt of you to inform me all about [your mission..." Thus Swayamprabha gave hospitality to the
monkeys.] [4-51-19b, 19c]

Though Sampaati's voice is turned husky by his sadness for the demise of his brother
Jataayu, the monkey commanders doubtingly disbelieved neither him nor even his words by the fact of
his being an eagle intending to kill and eat up all the monkeys. [4-57-1]

On seeing the eagle those fly-jumpers who sat for fast-unto-death have become
furious at the eagle thinking that, "that eagle wishes to eat up all of us..." Thus, the monkeys
deliberated the eagle's words. [4-57-2]

"We are sitting for fast-unto-death and if that eagle wishes eat us let it be so...
then our deliverance will be achieved in anyway and we will go to heaven from here..." Thus, some
other monkeys gave thought to lower that eagle down. [4-57-3]

When all of the monkey chiefs made up their mind in this way, then some of them on
going to the mountaintop brought that eagle down, and then Angada spoke to the eagle. [4-57-4]

"Oh, bird, my noble grandfather is known as Rikshaja who was a valorous and an
outstanding monkey among all monkeys, was the king of monkeys. He has two generous and great mighty
sons namely Vali and Sugreeva. My father Vali was highly renowned in the world for his bold acts,
and he became the king later to my grandfather... [4-57-5, 6]

"Among Ikshvaku-s there is a great-charioteer, a king for the entire world, a
peerless person, and he is the son of Dasharatha, namely Rama, and abiding by his father's
directives and opting for righteous course of conduct, he moved into Dandaka forests along with his
brother Lakshmana and even with his wife Vaidehi... [4-57-7, 8]

"Ravana forcibly abducted his wife from Janasthaana, namely Seetha, the princess
from Videha kingdom, and a kingly eagle named Jataayu, who is a friend of Rama's father Dasharatha,
has seen her while she was being abducted by skyway. [4-57-9, 10a]

"Jatayu is overly tired when he made Ravana's chariot defective and withheld
Maithili from abduction as he is senescent, then Ravana killed him in that conflict... [4-57-10b,
c]

"Thus that eagle was killed by that mighty Ravana, but solemnised by the obsequies
performed by Rama, he departed on a sublime avenue to heavens... [4-57-11]

"Then Raghava made friendship with my paternal uncle Sugreeva, an intellectual
autocrat, and Sugreeva got my father killed. Since Sugreeva antagonised my father, my father
interdicted him along with his ministers, and Rama killed my father Vali and anointed Sugreeva...
[4-57-12, 13]

"Rama enthroned Sugreeva as the ruler of all vanara-s and that king of all vanara
chiefs expedited all of us... [4-57-14]

"Though we are spearheaded by Rama and though we searched thereabouts for Vaidehi at
the behest of Sugreeva, as with a nightly sunshine Vaidehi is unattainable for us... [4-57-15]

"Such as we were we searched Dandaka forest very meticulously, but we unwittingly
entered into a wide-opened Black Hole of the earth... [4-57-16]

"During our search in that Black Hole, which was crafted by the wizardry of demon
Maya, the month fixed by our king for our return has been elapsed... [4-57-17]

"We who are all supposed to execute the order of our king, we have exceeded the
established norm of timeframe, and for fear of fury from our king Sugreeva we sat down for
fast-unto-death... [4-57-18]

"When Rama along with Lakshmana, and even Sugreeva will be infuriated by our
infringement of time, and even on our going to Kishkindha, as infringers there will be no survival
for all of us..." Thus Angada narrated their plight to Sampaati. [4-57-19]

"Oh, great enemy destroyer Rama, my elder brother Vali is a very dear one to our
father, and even for me too he was so, earlier. [4-9-1]

After the demise of our father all the ministers have glorified him immensely and
made him the king of all the monkeys as he is the elder. [4-9-2]

While he was ruling the great kingdom of my father and forefathers, I have always
bowed down to him like a servant and stood by him. [4-9-3]

There was a fierce demon named Maayaavi, the elder brother of Dundubhi and the son
of one demon named Maya. There was a great enmity between this Maayaavi and Vali owing to some
female. [4-9-4]

He that Maayaavi arrived at the doors of Kishkindha in a night when the people are
sleeping, and blared very much inviting Vali for a fight. [4-9-5]

Then my brother who was also sleeping well, on hearing that bellowing in a
clamouring voice, did not tolerate and came out speedily. [4-9-6]

Though the females and myself bowed reverently to prevent Vali, he came out of
palace in all his anger to kill that great demon. [4-9-7]

But Vali spurned all of us away and forged ahead, and then I also have started to go
along with Vali in all my predisposition. [4-9-8]

A great fear was induced in that demon on seeing my brother and me too coming from a
distance, and then he quickly ran away. [4-9-9]

While he is running away in fear we quickly followed him on a path that is barely
lit by moonlight of the moon who is just coming up. [4-9-10]

That demon speedily entered an un-enterable cavity under the ground, covered with
grass, and we too having reached there speedily stood at the aperture of that cavity for a while.
[4-9-11]

Then Vali has gone into the enfoldment of fury on observing the entry of that demon
into the hole, whereby his senses felt outraged, and he said this sentence to me. [4-9-12]

Then Vali said to me, "Now you stay here on the alert, Sugreeva, at the entrance of
this hole till I return on destroying the enemy in a fight on my entering this hole..."
[4-9-13]

On hearing those words I requested him to allow me too to come in to the hole, but
he being the great tormentor of his enemies disallowed it, and he made me to swear on his feet and
entered that hole. [4-9-15]

Well over a year is over after his entering into that cleavage, and to me too who
stayed at the entrance of the cleavage that much time had passed away. [4-9-15]

I thought I lost him for my brother is unseen, and in all fondness towards him my
mind started to doubt about some harm might have befallen on him. [4-9-16]

After a long time blood with foam gushed out that hole, and on seeing it I was
deeply saddened. [4-9-17]

Sounds of screaming demon came to my ear, but the screeches of my brother who is
involved in fight are unheard, in the least. [4-9-18]

Oh, friend, Rama... I have surmised and concluded in mind by the indications that my
brother is finished, and covered the cavity's opening with a mountain similar boulder, and
performed water oblations to my deceased brother with saddening pain, and then returned to
Kishkindha. But the ministers have persuaded and heard from me the actual happening though I was
concealing it. [4-9-19, 20]

Then duly summoned by all of those ministers I was crowned, and while I was ruling
the kingdom judiciously, oh, Raghava, that semi-human Vali returned on killing that demoniac enemy.
[4-9-21, 22a]

But on seeing me crowned his eyes were reddened in anger, and he arrested all my
ministers as he spoke rudely. [4-9-22b, 23a]

And oh, Raghava, though I was capable enough to counter him, my reason was
controlled by my esteem to brotherhood, and I was indisposed to commit that sin of defying
brotherhood. [4-9-23b, 24a]

He that brother of mine entered the capital thus on destroying the enemy, and I
hailed him as usual while respecting that audacious soul, but his inner self is unsatisfied and I
remained unblest. [4-9-24b, 25]

Oh, lord Rama, though I bowed with the crown touching his feet, he that rancorous
Vali showed no quarter towards me." So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-9-25]

Then the monkey commanders sat on that beautiful mountain surrounding the eagle from
all over, after that eagle has offered water-oblations for his deceased Jataayu and bathed for
purification. [4-60-1]

Sampaati who earned trustworthiness of monkeys, and who is sitting surrounded by all
monkeys, again gladly spoke to Angada who sat at his close by. [4-60-2]

"Oh, monkeys, you all be quiet and listen to my words alertly as I wish to recount
the actuality as to how I came to know about Maithili... [4-60-3]

"Oh, impeccable Angada, once I have fallen on the peak of this Mt. Vindhya when
sunrays completely burned my wings and limbs scorching in sun's heat... [4-60-4]

"On getting sensitivity after six days, and on looking in all directions I could not
recognise anything in the least, as I was helpless and frantic... [4-60-5]

"But then on observing all the oceans, mountains, rivers, lakes, provinces and
forests, I could regain senses... [4-60-6]

"Since this mountain is teeming with teams of birds, caves in its midriffs, and it
is with peaks of its own kind, thus I resolved this to be Mt. Vindhya at the coast of southern
ocean... [4-60-7]

"There was a sacred hermitage belonging to a sage of intense ascesis known as Sage
Nishaakara which was reverenced even by gods. [4-60-8]

"Eight thousand years have lapsed while I was living here on this mountain after the
departure of that probity knowing sage Nishakara to heaven. [4-60-9]

'I again reached the earth descending from the lopsided peak of Mt. Vindhya,
onerously and slowly, whereat the sacred-grass-blades are thorny... [4-60-10]

"As I was desiring to see that sage I neared that place with much anguish, because I
and Jataayu approached that sage for many a time in earlier times... [4-60-11]

"Near about his hermitage wind wiffles with a sweet-smell, and no tree is flowerless
and no tree is fruitless, whatsoever it is... [4-60-12]

"On nearing that sacred hermitage and sheltering myself at the base of a tree, I
waited there desirous to see that godly Nishaakara... [4-60-13]

"Then I saw the sage available distantly, returning facing north after performing
his holy bath, an unassailable sage irradiating the ambience with his radiance... [4-60-14]

"Bears, antelopes, tigers, lions, and diverse reptiles and snakes are following him
at his heel, as with living beings following a donor, or all-donating Brahma... [4-60-15]

"As to how the ministerial and military staff retrace steps when a king enters his
place-chambers, so also the animals and other beings on knowing the sage's entry into his
hermitage, retraced their steps and went away... [4-60-16]

"But the sage is gladdened on seeing me and though he has entered into his hermitage
he again came out in a moment and asked about the objective of my visit... [4-60-17]

" 'On seeing the deformity of your feathers, oh, gentle Sampaati, you
unidentifiable. These two wings of yours are fire burnt, but lives are let out in your body...'
Thus, the sage started to talk to me... [4-60-18]

" 'I have earlier seen you two eagle brothers, kingly eagles among eagles, similar
in your speed to Wind-god and form-changers by your wish... [4-60-19]

" 'You are the elder, isn't it! And Jataayu is your younger brother. You used to
touch my feet taking up human forms... [4-60-20]

"Is this falling of wings a result of any illness, if so what is it... or is this
any scourge imposed on you, if so, who is he... tell me all who am inquiring into those details...
[4-60-21]

Thus said by Rama in agony that monkey Sugreeva with his palms adjoined, and with
tears rolling in eyes and also voice trembling with tears said this to Rama. [4-7-1]

"Unfamiliar is the residence, or capability, or valour, or lineage of that sinning
demon from a sinister dynasty, in any wise... [4-7-2]

"Truthfully I am promising you, oh, enemy destroyer, as to how you will get back
Maithili therefor I strive to make effort, let anguish be discarded... [4-7-3]

"As to how you will satisfy yourself on killing Ravana along with his henchmen, and
as to how to you pride yourself thereby, I will make it happen in that way in no longer a time...
[4-7-4]

"Enough is this clinging on to despair, recollect your inherent courage, and it is
unseemly for persons of your sort to have this kind of mental ineptness... [4-7-5]

"Upon me too this yearning caused by the separation of wife has chanced, but I did
not despair this way, nor I have forsaken my courage... [4-7-6]

"Though I am a primitive monkey I am not totally disheartened for the distancing of
wife, why tell about a great soul like you who are well read and courageous... [4-7-7]

"It is apt of you to control trickling tears with courage, and equally it is inapt
of you to discard the courage and propriety of self-controlled people... [4-7-8]

"Either in a riddle, or in financial loss, or at the end of life, or in fear, a
courageous one does not sink down, but indeed introspects in his own mind... [4-7-9]

"Stupid is that man who always follows self-piteous sadness unable to control
himself, and he drowns down in that melancholy like a overweighing ship in waters... [4-7-10]

"Adjoined are my palms in this way beseeching you in friendship, kindly bear up your
self-esteem and you should not give any leeway to sadness... [4-7-11]

"Those that delve deep into moroseness, to them there is no happiness, and their
brilliance too dwindles, thus saddening is inapt on your part... [4-7-12]

"One well-engulfed in sadness doubts even his life, oh, king of kings, leave off
that sadness and just hold on to courage...[4-7-13]

"I am telling a benefiting and friendly thought, but not instructing you, should you
regard my friendship then your saddening is inapt..." [Thus said Sugreeva to Rama.] [4-7-14]

Sweetly solaced thus by that Sugreeva Rama dabbed his face with the edge of cloth,
which is covered fully with tears. [4-7-15]

Lord Rama steadied himself in his own nature by the words of Sugreeva, and on
embracing him Rama said this sentence to him. [4-7-16]

"Sugreeva, a friendly obligation that which is to be done, a benefiting, befitting
and a timely one too, is what you have performed with your friendly advise... [4-7-17]

"Oh, friend, I steadied myself in my own nature when implored by you... it is
impossible to get this kind of friend, especially at these times... [4-7-18]

"But, trying to search for Maithili and that furious, evil-minded demon Ravana, is
your endeavour... [4-7-19]

"What is to done by me that be said in all believability, and all your endeavour
will reap like the crops planted during rainy season in good lands... [4-7-20]

"What that is spoken by me is in my self-confidence but not in any self-conceit, oh,
tigerly-monkey, deem them as doubtless facts... [4-7-21]

"Untruth is not uttered by me earlier nor will be at anytime from now, and all this
I am promising you taking oath on that truthfulness alone.. [4-7-22]

Then on hearing the words of Rama Sugreeva along with his monkey ministers is
gladdened, especially of Rama promise. [4-7-23]

Then those two, the man and the monkey, met in privacy and both discussed in a
mutually befitting manner about their pleasures and pains. [4-7-24]

On hearing the word of that intellectual, highly capable one and the best king among
kings, namely Rama, he that Sugreeva, the chief among the monkey heroes, thought at heart that his
manoeuvre to surpass his dominant brother Vali is accomplished. [4-7-25]

"Then I have informed the Sage Nishaakara all about that impossible and
impracticable deed done indiscreetly by me and Jataayu and our following the Sun in red heat, as
well..." Thus Sampaati continued his legend. [4-61-1]

"Oh, godly sage, scorching sun has ulcerated me, shame perturbed my senses for not
protecting Jatayu, further I am haggard to descend this mountain to come to you, such I am I am
incapable to speak on, elaborately... [4-61-2]

"Fascinated by our arrogance and inquisitive of our relative triumphs, myself and
Jataayu competitively flew up far-away on the sky... [4-61-3]

"Before the sages on the peak of Mt. Kailash we have staked a stake that we two
shall follow the Sun till he reaches the great westerly mountain, namely Mt. Dusk... [4-61-4]

"We reached the sky in a trice to a height wherefrom we could see each of the
townships on the surface of earth, separately and singly, in the size of a chariot's wheel...
[4-61-5]

"We have seen and heard instrumental music somewhere, and somewhere else tinkling of
jewellery, and elsewhere singing of many ladies dressed in red... [4-61-6]

"On our quick rising to the sky and abiding in solar path we have observed that a
forest is positioned just as a patch of pasture on earth... [4-61-7]

"From there the earth covered with pebble like mountain heights appeared shingly,
and interwoven with yarn like rivers the surface of the earth is thready... [4-61-8]

"Himalayas, even Mt. Vindhya, and even the very high mountain Mt. Meru, shone forth
like elephants in lakes... [4-61-9]

"Then there bechanced an abnormal sweating, tiredness and fear, and then stupor
invading both of us, we two underwent a severe vertigo... [4-61-10]

"We are not in the know of southern direction which belongs to Yama, the Terminator,
nor of south-east which belongs to Fire-god, also not of west which belongs to Rain-god... and the
world appeared as though burnt down by the fire at the end of era and destructed of its routine...
[4-61-11]

"Though my brainpower is deranged I again tried laboriously just depending on my
sight. I again tried strenuously concentrating my brainpower and sight on Sun and I have directly
seen the Sun. Then the Sun appeared in a size equal to the earth. [4-61-12, 13]

"Without informing me Jataayu started to trip over the earth, and then on seeing him
I too let myself loose from the sky... [4-61-14]

"I have hidden Jataayu in sky with both my wings from the scorching Sun... hence, he
is not burn that much... but I am completely burnt when falling from the sky... [4-61-15]

"I supposed that Jataayu as has fallen in Janasthaana, but I have fallen on Mt.
Vindhya, as a wing-burnt and insensate eagle... [4-61-16]

"As one who is divested of his kingdom, his brother, both of his wings, and his own
valance too, such as I was I wished to fall from the mountaintop to die, in any way...

Those lion-hearted fly-jumpers who are informed thus by the kingly eagle Sampaati have gladly jumped and loped 
and screamed in league [4-64-1]

On hearing the words of Sampaati, the monkeys have delightedly come to the ocean to go to the residence of Ravana, 
longing for a glimpse of Seetha. [4-64-2]

Passing across that province those superbly venturesome monkeys have seen the ocean available there, appearing 
like a great mirror image of the world in it entirety. [4-64-3]

On reaching the northern side of southern ocean those best monkeys have collectively made a camp there. [4-64-4]

That ocean is uproarious with its tides, and with its gigantic and misshapen beings that are sporting in water 
with their wide-opened mouths.

Somewhere that ocean is as though sleeping well, and somewhere else it is as though sporting, elsewhere it is 
overspread with tidewaters as high as mountains, somewhere else it is tumultuous with the best demonic beings 
who are the residents on the plane of netherworld, and the elephantine monkeys despaired on seeing such a hair-raising 
ocean.. [4-64-5, 6]

On seeing the shoreless ocean that is like an endless sky, hence unnavigable, the vanara-s are despaired and said 
each to each, "how to vault this ocean?" [4-64-7]

Then the best one among monkeys, Angada, started to inspirit the army of monkeys who are anguished by fear on 
their gazing at the ocean. [4-64-8]

"Loosing heart to dismay is an unworkability, because dismaying itself is detrimental, and dismay alone ruins 
a person, as a vicious viper unworkably ruins an innocent child... [4-64-9]

"Individual achievement will be unachievable to him who readily braces himself with despair when the time for 
venturesomeness verges on, because of the lacking of his own vitality..." So said Angada and then the nightfall 
has occurred. [4-64-10]

While that night is elapsing into the wee hours of next day, Angada met all the golden-ager monkeys, and again 
deliberated with them. [4-64-11]

When those troops of monkey army stood encircling Angada, it beamed forth like the army of gods encircling Indra. 
[4-64-12]

Who can capably consolidate that army of monkeys, other than Vali's son Angada, or, other than Hanuma? None. Because 
that army itself is an army of fickly, tickly monkeys. [4-64-13]

Then that enemy-subjugator and illustrious Angada, on revering the old-ager monkeys and paying due respects to 
the army of monkeys, spoke this meaningful sentence. [4-64-14]

"Now, who is that great-resplendent one who can vault over the ocean and who is he who can facilitate the enemy-repressor 
Sugreeva to become truthful to his word... [4-64-15]

"Who is that brave hurdler who can hurdle over a hundred yojana distance, oh, fly-jumpers, who is he who can even 
emancipate all these monkey commanders from the great fear of Sugreeva... [4-64-16]

"By whose benignancy we can rejoicingly see our wives, sons, houses and homes on going back from here after achieving 
the purpose of our task... [4-64-17]

"By whose benevolence we can unworriedly approach Rama, or even that irascible Lakshmana, or ruthless Sugreeva, 
as well... [4-64-18]

"If someone among you is competent enough to jump over the ocean, that monkey may now quickly give us all, a munificence, 
called a solemn impunity from Sugreeva..." Angada addressed monkeys in this way. [4-64-19]

On hearing Angada's words there is none someone to say something in that matter, as the entire monkey troop is 
as though dumbfounded. [4-64-20]

Again that best one among monkeys Angada clearly said to those monkeys thus, "all of you are the best ones among 
powerful monkeys, you all are determinedly venturesome, born in flawless families and even adored again and again 
for your adventures... [4-64-21]

"There will be no barrier to whomsoever, whensoever he wanted essay wheresoever, isn't it! Hence, oh, best fly-jumpers, 
each one you may give an account as to which one has got which capability in jump-leaping the ocean. [4-64-22]

Hanuma, the leader of monkeys, then neared and slowly consoled Tara who has fallen to ground like a 
star from sky. [4-21-1]

"Living beings on doing the deeds of merit or demerit, or knowingly or unknowingly, will derive the 
resultant fruits of those deeds according to one's own destiny even after demise, and they shall bear 
them unrepentantly, may they be provident or improvident... [4-21-2]

"Of which lamentable one you lament while you yourself are in a lamentable state? Of which pitiable 
one you take pity while you yourself are in a pitiable condition? Who is pitiable by whom in these bubbles 
like bodies? [4-21-3]

"You are the one with a living son, and you have to look after this young one Angada, and you have to 
think of the forthcoming activities for his well-being and for his performance of duty towards his father. 
[4-21-4]

"You are aware that the coming and going of beings, in their subtle forms of earth, water, fire, air 
and space into this mortal life and back is uncertain, thereby the prudent ones have to perform auspicious 
worldly deeds here in this world, say, the funeral of Vali. [4-21-5]

"In whom hundreds and thousands of monkeys are harboured and astir, for they have reposed their confidence 
in him alone, that Vali has arrived at his end. [4-21-6]

"By which reason this Vali conducted himself judiciously, observing friendliness, courteousness and 
forgivingness, by that reason alone Vali is going to a domain in heavens which he righteously conquered 
for himself, and it is unapt of your sorrowing for him. [4-21-7]

"All the tigerly-monkeys, oh, impeccable Tara, including this son of yours Angada, and all the lords 
of monkeys and bears have their guardian angel in you. [4-21-8]

"Oh, lady, inspirit these two, Sugreeva and Angada, that are searing in grief, and if you acquiesce 
then this Angada will rule over the earth. [4-21-9]

"Whatever duty anticipated from a male descendent towards his father, and whatever activity that is 
to be done presently in respect of the dying king, let them be done, and that would be a timely decision. 
[4-21-10]

"Cremation of the king of monkeys and anointment of Angada are the present time affairs, and seeing 
your son invested on the throne you can obtain peace." Thus spoke Hanuma to Tara. [4-21-11]

On hearing Hanuma's words she who is tormented by the plight of her husband, that Tara replied Hanuma 
who is standing nearby. [4-21-12]

"Let there be a hundred selfsame Angada-s on one side, and this brave one the other, for me embracing 
him who is put to death is the best .... [4-21-13]

"Who am I either for conducting the monkeys kingdom or to anoint Angada when Angada's paternal-uncle 
Sugreeva is close at hand? [4-21-14]

"Hanuma, this thinking of yours that Angada is to be crowned is really untenable, oh, best monkey, father 
is the real defender of a son, but not the mother. [4-21-15]

"Indeed there is nothing highly befitting to me, either in this world or in the other, than the auspices 
of the king of monkeys, and now to me the only befitting thing is to join in this brave one on this 
death bed, which he is adoring when put to death while he is facing away. [4-21-16]

"On informing the sage in this way I wept as I was highly despaired. Then on
meditating for a while that sage said this..." Thus Sampaati continued his narration, and now he
reports to Angada and others what that is said by Sage Nishaakara to him. [4-62-1]

" 'Again both of your wings will emerge as small wings anew, also thus your valour,
power, and life-force will comeback...' Thus Sage Nishaakara started to console Sampaati.
[4-62-2]

" 'In olden days I have heard that a very great happening is going to happen indeed,
and it is known to me as I perceived it ascetically... [4-62-3]

"There is some king known as Dasharatha, an enhancer of Ikshvaku dynasty, and to him
there will be a great-resplendent a son who will be known as Rama... [4-62-4]

" 'When his father assigns him for that objective of his going to forests, that
truth-valiant Rama goes to forests along with his brother Lakshmana... [4-62-5]

" 'A demon named Ravana, the chief of demons, and an unkillable one even for gods or
demons abducts Rama's wife from Janasthaana... [4-62-6]

" 'She that Maithili, a highly privileged and prestigious lady does not touch any
food, though she is highly lured by banquets and feasts by that Ravana, for she will be sunken in
sorrow... [4-62-7]

" 'On knowing Seetha's plight Indra gives a nectarean food for Vaidehi, which food
is renowned to be Nectarous and unattainable even by gods... [4-62-8]

" 'But on getting that food, and on knowing that it is from Indra, Maithili takes up
the first morsel and dispenses it on the surface of earth for Rama, saying... [4-62-9]

" 'If my husband is living, or even my younger brother-in-law Lakshmana is living,
or even if they have attained godhood, this food belongs to both of them...' Saying so Seetha
offers oblation to them... [4-62-10

" 'Ushered by Rama, oh, sky-flyer Sampaati, fly-jumpers will be going over to the
place where Seetha is captivated as harbingers of Rama, and you ought to tell those monkeys about
the queen of Rama... [4-62-11]

" 'In any case you ought not to go-as-you-please... a wingless eagle of your kind
where you wish to go... await the times and scenes, you will regain both of your wings...
[4-62-12]

" 'I am capable of making you a winged eagle now itself, but how can you stay here
and do an agreeable deed to the worlds! So you have to wait. [4-62-13]

" 'That deed aimed at the wellbeing of both those princes, Rama and Lakshmana, and
of Brahmans, teaches, sages and also of Indra is to be done by you alone, isn't it! [4-62-14]

" 'Even I wish to see those brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, but I do not wish to bear
lives prolongedly, hence I castaway my mortal body...' and thus that is what the great sage
Nishakara said to me. Saying so that sage, who is a discerner who discerned the sum and substance
of Supreme Person castaway his mortal body in his ascent to heaven." Sampaati continued his
narration in this way. [4-62-15]

At which mountain's tableland those monkeys sat down for self-immolation, to that
area the elder brother of Jataayu, a kingly eagle known as Sampaati by name, one renowned one for
his forcefulness and aggressiveness, and a celebrated and sempiternal sky-flying eagle has arrived.
[4-56-1, 2]

On coming out of the cave of the great-mountain Vindhya, Sampaati is gladden at
heart to see the monkeys sitting down there, and he spoke these words. [4-56-3]

"Whether it is good or bad, fate indeed follows humans in this world procedurally,
why because, this fated and long-waited food has now come nigh of me... [4-56-4]

"I wish to eat them frugally, killing one by one and eating one by one, preying on
one on one day, and then preying upon the other on the other day..." thus that bird spoke those
words on seeing the massy fly-jumpers. [4-56-5]

On hearing the words of that gormandising bird, Angada became highly breathless and
then spoke to Hanuma. [4-56-6]

"Look! In the name of an eagle, the son of the Sun, Yama, the Terminator, has
manifestly arrived at this area for the fatality of monkeys... thus ill luck is still haunting
us... [4-56-7]

"We fulfilled neither Rama's task, nor the decree of our king, but this unknown
catastrophe has abruptly bechanced for the monkeys... [4-56-8]

"You all have heard in its entirety what deed the kingly Jataayu has done wishing to
do good to Vaidehi... [4-56-9]

"Like that all beings, even those birthed in animality, are doing what that is
agreeable to Rama even on forgoing their own lives, as with us... [4-56-10]

"Even animals will be mutually succouring by their instinct of concern and
camaraderie, therefore, let each of us leave off our souls, soulfully... [4-56-11]

"Conscientious Jataayu has done a deed much liked by Rama, and we too have been
trekking the forests without caring even for our lives in the cause of Rama, but we have not seen
Maithili... [4-56-12, 13a]

"He that kingly eagle Jataayu who is killed by Ravana is a happy soul, and he is
even relieved from the fear of Sugreeva as he departed on the Avenue of Sublimity... [4-56-13b,
c]

"By the ending of Jataayu and by the end of Dasharatha, also by the purloin of
Vaidehi, all of the monkeys are piled into a predicament... [4-56-14]

"Just by giving boons to Kaikeyi, the quandaries like Rama's dwelling in forests
along with Seetha and Lakshmana, as a result Rama's fury eliminating complete demons of
Janasthaana, and as a result Raghava's arrow exterminating Val, have come to pass." Thus Angada is
lamenting. [4-56-15,16]

On observing the monkeys who lay recumbent on ground and on hearing them eulogising
the death of Jataayu he that king of eagles Sampaati is highly perturbed at that uncomfortable
information about Jatayu, and that high minded Sampaati sorrowfully spelled out this word.
[4-56-17]

That shredder-billed eagle Sampaati said this sentence voicing thunderously on
hearing words voiced by Angada. [4-56-18]

"Who speaks to announce as though to quake my heart that Jatayu, the more precious
brother of mine than my own lives, is slain? [4-56-19]

"How a combat occasioned between that eagle and a demon in Janasthaana, and how am I
hearing this name of my brother after a long time... [4-56-20]

"I wish you to get me down from these mountain soars. After a long time I have heard
about my younger brother who is straightforward, praiseworthy for his valour, and I am glad that
too spoke of him praisefully... [4-56-21, 22a]

"Thereby, oh, best vanara-s, I wish to listen about the death of my brother Jataayu
when he was in Janasthaana... [4-56-22b, 23a]

"Whose eldest and dear son is Rama, the creditable one for doyens, that Dasharatha
is the friend of my brother Jatayu/ But how did Dasharatha pass away? [4-56-23b, 24a]

"I am incapable to spread my wings widely as they are burnt by Sun's rays, hence oh,
enemy-chasteners, I wish you to lower me down from this mountain..." Thus Sampaati sought for the
help of monkeys. [4-56-24b, c]

When the chiefs of monkey-troops are on their way Rama spoke to Sugreeva, "Indeed, how do you know very-well about 
the globe of earth in its entirety?" [4-46-1]

Then Sugreeva bowing down before Rama said, "I will narrate all vividly, and let my words be heard." [4-46-2]

"When Vali repulsed the buffalo-shaped demon Dundubhi towards Malaya mountain, then that buffalo entered the cave 
of Mt. Malaya, and even Vali entered therein wishing to kill that buffalo. [4-46-3, 4]

"Vali then kept me at the mouth of the cave as I was an amenable brother, but Vali did not exit from cave even 
after one full year. [4-46-5]

"I was dumbfounded to see that cave is then fully filled with blood, and then a venom like anguish called the 
loss of my brother agonised me. [4-46-6]

"Then I concluded that 'my brother is unmistakably killed,' and then I fixed a mountain similar boulder in the 
mouth of that cavity with a thinking that it will be impossible for that buffalo to exit and it will get destroyed 
within that cave itself. [4-46-7, 8a]

"Unhopeful of Vali's aliveness then I arrived in Kishkindha, and on getting the very magnificent kingdom of Kishkindha, 
and also Ruma along with Tara, I was peaceably staying there with friends. [4-46-8, 9]

"Vali then came back to Kishkindha on killing that great demon, and then I was spellbound in fear of Vali's killing 
me, and I gave back the kingdom to Vali owing to my deference to him. [4-46-10]

"That evil-minded Vali becoming highly perturbed at his senses furiously repulsed me further and further away, 
even though I was running away from him with my ministers, as he wished to kill me. [4-46-11]

"Such as I was, who is repulsed by Vali, I was made to run away rapidly, and during that fleeing I went on seeing 
diverse rivers, forests and cities. [4-46-12]

"I have then really seen the earth as in the reflection on the surface of a mirror, where the mirror shows all 
the objects in exactness, and the earth is like the circle of a fireball, where it is encircled with fire-like 
reddish, brownish, ochreish minerals and ores, and it appeared to me in my high flight like a cow-hoof-print in 
the mirror, called my perception. [4-46-13]

"Then on going to eastern direction I saw various trees, enchanting mountains with caves, and also numerous lakes. 
[4-46-14]

"There I saw the mountain wreathed in with ores, namely Mt. Udaya, the Sun-Rise, and I have also seen the Milk 
Water Oceans which is forever an abode for apsara-s. [4-46-15]

"I fled speedily when Vali repulsed me, but oh, lord Rama, when I returned he again made me to flee forthwith. 
[4-46-16]

"Then from that eastern direction I fled to southern direction, which is thick with Vindhya Range mountains and 
diverse trees, especially with sandalwood trees. [4-46-17]

"While I was seeing the interiors of forest and mountains again I was made to run by Vali, who was setting upon 
me from within the interiors of those forests and mountains, and then I reached the western direction. [4-46-18]

"Such as I was, on seeing diverse cities and the best mountain Astagiri, Mt. Dusk, I reached that excellent Mt. 
Dusk also, and since Vali is at my heel, I took to my heels, by a long way to north. [4-46-19]

"Even at Himalayas, Mt. Meru, like that at the Northern Ocean, Vali drove me back, and when the clemency from 
Vali, or a shelter, or even a foothold on earth was indeterminable, then Hanuma, whose prosperity is his wisdom, 
said a word to me. [4-46-20, 21a]

" 'Oh, king Sugreeva, now I remember how Sage Matanga cursed the king of monkeys Vali at that time. If Vali really 
enters the fringes of the hermitage of Sage Matanga, Vali's head gets splintered in hundred ways. Hence dwelling 
in sage Matanga's hermitage will be peaceful and imperturbable for us.' Thus Hanuma spoke to me. [4-46-21b, 22, 
23a]

"Oh, prince Rama, then Vali though reached Mt. Rishyamuka, he did not enter into its precincts at that time fearing 
Sage Matanga and his curse, oh, king Rama, thus this globe of earth is apparently and closely sighted by me in 
its entirety, and then I came into the cave of Rishyamuka and did not stir out." So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-46-23b, 
24]

Hanuma, the monkey, quickly started along with Angada, Lt. Tara, and others to that
province which Sugreeva has indicated, namely the south. [4-48-1]

Arriving at a remote place with all of those powerful monkeys, then Hanuma searched
the caves and forests of Vindhya Mountains, and on their mountaintops, at impassable places, at
rivers and lakes, and in stands of trees with beamy trees, also on diverse mountains, forests and
trees. [4-48-2, 3]

Though all of those brave vanara-s have searched in all directions they have not
noticed the princess of Mithila and the daughter of Janaka, namely Seetha. [4-48-4]

Feeding upon unalike fruits and tubers, sojourning here and there, those
invulnerable vanara-s conducted their search. [4-48-5]

But that province is an inscrutable one, deeply caved, deeply forested, much less of
water and still less of people, a void and an impenetrable one with a ghastly look. [4-48-6]

They are highly tormented when they vainly searched there, and even in another
province that is also of the same kind, waterless and people-less, and an unreachable one,
abstrusely caved and forested. [4-48-7]

Then all of those monkey commanders gave up that province and entered another
impermeable province as they are fearless from any quarter. [4-48-8]

Whereat the trees are infertile for fruiting, destitute of leaves and flowers, and
whereat the brooks are deprived of waters, and whereat it is highly impossible to get even tubers,
there they entered. [4-48-9]

Where there are no buffalos, no elephants, no animals, nor even birds or tigers, or
no other forest moving beings are there, for they do not have their feed there, they entered such a
province. [4-48-10]

Where there are no useful trees, nor herbal plants, nor climbing plants on trees,
nor creeping plants on earth, and lotus-lakes which will be normally pleasing for sight have no
soft leaves, nor bloomed lotuses on their creepers, and even honeybees are discarding them as they
are not richly fragranced, in such a province those vanara-s have entered. [4-48-11,12a]

A highly fortunate, veracious, ascetically wealthy sage known as Kandu is there in
that province, and that great sage is a highly short-tempered, and an impossible one to subjugate
by virtue of his own self-discipline. [4-48-12b, 13a]

In that forest that sage lost his son, a ten-year-old boy, as that boy's life ended
there by which that great sage is infuriated. [4-48-13b, 14a]

Thereby that virtue-souled sage cursed that great forest in it entirety to become an
uninhabitable and impermeable forest abandoned by birds and animals. [4-48-14b, 15a]

But those monkeys conscientiously searched such a forest up to its fringes,
including its mountains, caves, fountains, and rivers. [4-48-15b, 16a]

But not finding the daughter of Janaka or even her kidnapper Ravana there, those
monkeys who are the perfecters of that which is acceptable to Sugreeva, have entered another
fearsome forest. [4-48-16b, 17a]

On entering another fearsome forest which is overly encompassed with climbers and
shrubberies they saw a demon of fiendish deeds who is fearless of gods. [4-48-17b, 18a]

All of those vanara-s are amazed to see that fiendish demon standing similar to a
mountainous boulder, and apprehending an imminent danger on observing that mountain similar demon,
those vanara-s have tightly girthed their wrestler's girdle-cloth. [4-48-18b, 19a]

Even that mighty demon shouting at all vanara-s, 'you are all dead... stay,' rushed
towards them shoving up his clenched fist. [4-48-19b, 20a]

Angada, the son of Vali, then presumed him who is onrushing as Ravana and saying,
'he is Ravana...' he quickly thwacked that demon indeed with his palm. [4-48-20b, 21a]

When Vali's son whacked him that demon spewed forth blood from his throat and fell
onto ground alike an inverted mountain. [4-48-21b, 22a]

When that demon breathed his last all of those monkeys with triumphal shimmer have
wellnigh searched everywhere, and even in that cave of that mountain where that demon appeared,
presuming that cave belonged to Ravana. [4-48-22b, 23a]

Then all those forest dwelling monkeys searched everywhere else, and like that they
entered another horrible cave which is nearby. [4-48-23b, 24a]

On searching that cave they came out saddened as their search is futile, and coming
together they sat down at the base of a lonely tree downheartedly as their efforts are unsuccessful
in searching Seetha. [4-48-24]

Sugreeva expressly broached the topic of searching Seetha with Hanuma, as Sugreeva is decidedly determined about 
Hanuma, because that best one among monkeys, namely Hanuma, alone is decidedly the achiever of purpose. [4-44-1]

The king of all the residents of forest Sugreeva is well pleased to pick and choose Hanuma for the purpose, and 
spoke to the venturesome son of Air-god, Hanuma. [4-44-2]

"Oh, foremost monkey, Hanuma, I do not foresee any impediment in your transit on land where homogenous enemies 
will usually obstruct one another, or in high skies where there is no foothold, thus only birds and clouds hover 
there, or in the wild blue yonder where celestial bodies alone gravitate at random, nor in waters where there 
is no underwater movement for earthly beings, nor in the heaven, the abodes of immortals, where those immortals 
will not allow mortals like us to meander as we like. [4-44-3]

"All the worlds that contain demons, gandharva-s, naaga-s, humans, gods, and the oceans and mountains therein 
are known to you. [4-44-4]

"With your unusual mobility, unstoppable celerity, unremitting vivacity, and untold ability you are identical 
to your father Maaruti, the Air-god of marvelling dynamism. [4-44-5]

"Or even by your radiancy none on earth is coming to mind who can be a coequal of yours, thereby you alone shall 
think about that process as to how to access Seetha. [4-44-6]

"Oh, Hanuma, in you alone there are brawniness, astuteness and venturesomeness, and oh, ethicist, you conduct 
yourself in abidance with time, place and ethicality." Thus Sugreeva said to Hanuma. [4-44-7]

Raghava started pondaration when he is cognisant of the entrustment of the task to Hanuma and on cognising Hanuma 
as an efficient cause. [4-44-8]

"This king of monkeys, Sugreeva, is anywise definitive in his resolve reposed in Hanuma, and Hanuma is definitely 
resolute in achieving the task. [4-44-9]

"By that reason Hanuma must have good track record of the tasks he accomplished earlier, besides, he is specifically 
chosen by his king. As such, this Hanuma will certainly bring task to fruition.

"This Sugreeva is well-aware of each individual's accomplishments and hence he specifically chose Hanuma, and 
Hanuma who is now transiting must be individually well-known for accomplishment of any task assigned to him. Hence 
the fruition of the task is certain." Thus, Rama pondered. [4-44-10]

On perusing Hanuma who is the ablest one in his endeavours, the highly resplendent Rama is immensely delighted, 
and his heart and senses are elated as if his purpose has been achieved. [4-44-11]

Then that enemy-inflamer Rama happily gave his ring that is shining forth with his own name engraved as sign to 
Hanuma, as a remembrancer for princess Seetha. [4-44-12]

"By this emblematic ring, oh, best monkey, Janaka's daughter Seetha identifies you to have reached her from my 
proximity, without apprehension. [4-44-13]

"Oh, brave one, your enthusiasm, vital-force combined with your venturesomeness, and also the message of Sugreeva 
to you, are as if heralding achievement to me." Thus, Rama spoke to Hanuma while giving his ring. [4-44-14]

On taking the ring that foremost monkey Hanuma kept it on his own head, and making palm-fold he reverenced the 
feet of Rama, and then that noteworthy monkey started off. [4-44-15]

That brave monkey-son of Air-god leapt to sky along with that massive force of monkeys as if he is hauling them 
up, and he who is brightened by monkeys around him on the skyscape appeared like the moon in a very clear lunar 
sphere on a cloudless sky brightened by clusters of stars around. [4-44-16]

"Oh, highly powerful Hanuma, I rely upon your vivacity, being the best venturesome monkey, oh, son of Air-god, 
showing your adventures that are not inconsequential you make happen as to how access can be gained to Janaka's 
daughter, Seetha." Thus, Rama shouted at Hanuma flying in the sky. [4-44-17]

On hearing the polite and righteous words of Hanuma, which are just yeomanly towards Hanuma's lord, namely Sugreeva, 
Angada said these sentences. [4-55-1]

"Un-deducible in Sugreeva are his steadiness, or harmlessness, or frankness, also thus salience, or even valiance, 
further more cleanliness of heart or soul. [4-55-2]

"Which Sugreeva has arrogated his elder brother's wife when that elder brother is still alive and well, where 
she is morally his motherlike, an empress and a lady love of that elder brother, thus he is despicable, and which 
Sugreeva closed the mouth of the cavity when his brother in all his belief assigned and stationed him alone at 
the mouth of the cavity to fightback the demon Dundubhi if he tries to escape, all the more when his own brother 
is still inside the cavity, thus he is nefarious, how then he can be said as one conversant with moral rectitude? 
[4-55-3, 4]

"Which Sugreeva has overlooked no less than the great glorious Raghava, whom he truthfully befriended and from 
whom his own task of arrogating my kingdom by eliminating my father is facilitated, how then can he remember the 
good services of others like us? [4-55-5]

"He has ordered and sent us for searching Seetha owing to the fear from Lakshmana, but not as a coward fearing 
his own unscrupulousness, how then can scrupulosity be manifest in him? [4-55-6]

"Who is that respectable one who can put belief in Sugreeva, while that Sugreeva is shameful by his shameless 
act of eliminating my father, and unmindful of tradition in usurping my mother and throne, and unthankful in requiting 
Rama by himself, instead of using us as pawns, and changeful in ignoring his promise to Rama, but in fearing for 
Lakshmana? Will it be possible especially for one like me belonging to his family? [4-55-7]

"Whether a son is honest or dishonest he alone is investable in the kingdom. How then can Sugreeva let me, the 
one from the family of his enemy, live on? [4-55-8]

"My slyness in planning to live in Black Hole has backfired, I am now culpable in not finding Seetha being the 
troop leader, and I am a powerless as you all are Sugreeva's side, how then can I live on indeed after reaching 
Kishkindha, like caitiff turned into a wretch. [4-55-9]

"Indeed he surceases me by some mysterious trammelling punishment, for that Sugreeva becomes disingenuous, ferocious, 
also barbarous just for the reason of his kingship. [4-55-10]

"Fast unto death behoves me than trammels and tramples, thus you all be acquiescent to my proposal and you may 
go back to your dwellings. [4-55-11]

"I am reiterating to you all that I do not wish to go to the city of Kishkindha, and here only I sit fasting unto 
death, as death alone is expedient to me. [4-55-12]

"On my behalf Raghava-s wellbeing may be enquired firstly paying deference to them, so also the wellbeing of my 
paternal uncle and king may be enquired, only after paying deference to that lord of vanara-s. [4-55-13, 14a]

"My step-mother Ruma may be asked after regarding her healthiness. And it will be apt of you to solace my mother 
Lady Tara, who by her nature is a warm-hearted and austerely lady who cherishes her son more, and such as she 
is she will obviously leave off her life on hearing that I breathed my last." So said Angada to all monkeys. [4-55-14b, 
16a]

On speaking to that point and after paying deference to older vanara-s available there, Angada puling glum facedly 
reclined on the sacred grass spread on ground. [4-55-16b, 17a]

Apropos to Angada's recumbency on ground, the other outstanding Vanara-s snivellingly sluiced down seethingly 
effusive teardrops emotionally. [4-55-17b, 18a]

While disesteeming Sugreeva but esteeming Vali, all of the vanara-s have gathered around Angada deciding to sit 
down for fasting unto death in step with Angada. [4-55-18b, 19a]

Those best ones among fly-jumpers on discerning the words of Angada, the son of Vali, and agreeing to what all 
said by Angada as appropriate, they positioned themselves on the sacred grass after touching waters sacramentally. 
The sacred-grass is spread as sacred beds to cast off their lives. The edges of grass blades are positioned southward. 
As they are on that northern shore of southern ocean, all those best monkeys who are bent on to self-immolation, 
they became recumbent facing eastward. [4-55-19b, 21a]

An unknown apprehensive dread came upon those monkeys when they discussed Rama's living in forests, Dasharatha's 
demise, calamity caused to Janasthaana, casualty to Jataayu, like that the stealing of Vaidehi and slaying of 
Vali. [4-55-21, 22]

While those many fly-jumpers who mirror up great mountaintops by their physique are recumbent discussing stridently, 
the entrails of caves of mountain are rendered strident, and that mountain itself appeared like skyscape filled 
with strident clouds about to burst a good fortune. [4-55-23]

Then the illiberal Vali has clearly heard that outcry of his plain-spoken brother
Sugreeva from his palace chambers. [4-15-1]

On hearing Sugreeva's outcry that is shuddering all beings Vali's insolence is
diminished as high furore superimposed on it. [4-15-2]

Then, embitterment overspreading on all his limbs Vali with golden-hue is
immediately rendered non-luminous like the eclipsed sun. [4-15-3]

With asymmetrical teeth and with burning fireball like eyes Vali is reflective of a
lake whose red-lotuses are uprooted leaving stalks afloat. [4-15-4]

That monkey Vali then on hearing that intolerable noise bolted out of palace
chambers thumping his feet as though to shatter the earth. [4-15-5]

His wife Tara stepped in and showing goodwill and amity hugged him, for she is in
fear and bewilderment, and said this word that is beneficial in its futurity if Vali heeds it.
[4-15-6]

"Oh brave one, you better gently leave off this anger that is coming on like a
gushing river as is done with an enjoyed chaplet on getting up from bed in early hours.
[4-15-7]

"Oh, monkey, you can fight with him in early hours of tomorrow, oh, brave one,
evidently you neither have divers enemies nor your valour is trivialised."

"You can fight with him at appropriate time, thereby your enemy is neither glorified
nor you are trivialised evidently, for you are a braving one. [4-15-8]

"Your quick exiting is disagreeable for me, and what for you are dissuaded that may
be listened as I tell. [4-15-9]

"Earlier Sugreeva came assaulting and inviting you for a combat, and you also have
gone out and rendered him as a nonentity, and being battered by you he fled in all directions.
[4-15-10]

"He who is undone earlier by you, particularly after torturing by you, his coming
here again and inviting you for a duel is causing a doubt in me. [4-15-11]

"The arrogance and endeavour of the shouter, and even the rampage of his furore, all
these will not have a trivial reason, isn't it. [4-15-12]

"I do not think that Sugreeva has come here unaccompanied, and on whom he is
dependant must be an unflinching support foregathered by Sugreeva. [4-15-13]

"By his nature Sugreeva is an expert and even so a clever one, and he does not enter
into friendship with anyone without examining his mettle. [4-15-14]

"I am already briefed by our son Angada's information, and what I have heard I will
now relate that helpful word to you. [4-15-15]

"Son Angada said this account when he returned from forests, and to him spies are
said to have reported this. [4-15-16]

"Those that are born in Ikshvaku dynasty, sons of the king of Ayodhya, valiant and
unconquerable ones in war, called Rama and Lakshmana are there in this country. These two
unassailable ones have chanced there at Sugreeva's place to fulfil the longing desire of Sugreeva.
[4-15-17, 18a]

"He is an acclaimed one for his warfare, and like the fire flaring up at the end of
era he shatters the strength of enemies, and he is Rama your brother's helpmate, they say so.
[4-15-18b, 19a]

"And he is said to the habitable tree for the polite, the ultimate course for the
woebegone, a hospice for the agonised, and for grace Rama is the only abode. [4-15-19b, 20a]

"He is endowed with the knowledge of mundane and ultra-mundane things, he always
abides in the directives of his father, and as with Mt. Himalayas for all natural elements he is
the greatest mine of merits. [4-15-20b, 21a]

"By that reason, with that unconquerable on in conflicts, an imponderable one and a
great-soul Rama, your enmity is inapposite. [4-15-21b, 22a]

"Oh dauntless one, I tell you this much that you shall not become overcritical of
him, and what I say is beneficial to you that may now be listened and even implemented. [4-15-22b,
23a]

"Oh, king, let Sugreeva be decorously and quickly anointed as prince regent, and oh,
resolute one, let there be no hostility to your own younger brother. [4-15-23b, 24a]

"Achieving unanimity with Sugreeva and solidarity with Rama by discarding enmity, in
effect is appropriate for you, thus I deem. [4-15-24b, 25a]

"This Sugreeva is your younger brother and you should be keen about him, isn't it...
and whether he is here or there in Rishyamuka he is just your brother. [4-15-25b, 26a]

"Indeed, I do not see anyone on earth a coequal to him in kindred spirit, hence
leave off this enmity and honour him with bestowals and felicitations as an insider, and retain him
at your side. [4-15-26b, 27]

"That boisterously voiced Sugreeva is indisputably an excellent kinsman of yours,
and hence brace yourself with the fondness of brotherhood, as there is no other way out to you.
[4-15-28]

"If you look upon to do my favoured deed, and if you look upon me as an expedient
one, I beg of you in our loving attachment that my gentle word of advise be done. [4-15-29]

"Be graceful and it behove you to listen to my small but expedient talk, and
following up rancour alone is unbecoming of you, thereby your confrontation with the Prince of
Kosala will be unpardonable for his dynamism equals that of Indra." Thus Tara spoke to her husband
Vali. [4-15-30]

Then, though Tara spoke beneficial and advisable words they are unimpressive to Vali
for he is impounded by fatality and driven by time to his doom. [4-15-31]

On observing clear sky on which back-clouds and electric charges have disappeared, on which Saarasa birds are 
vibrantly bustling and delightful moonshine is coated, and even on observing him whose riches are abundant, who 
has slowed down in accumulating probity and prosperity from the viewpoint of rectitude, highly engrossed in the 
course of unvirtuous profligates, whose heart is given to undisturbed privacy, and the one who on achieving his 
goals and dearest longings has turned away from other pursuits, who regained his choicest wife, and gained highly 
covetable Lady Tara, thus, who is always indulged in females, merrymaking day in and day out on a par with Indra, 
which Indra will be sporting with the cohorts of gandharva and apsara females, thereby he who is making much of 
his fortune on getting rid of other problems, besides, he who reposed the activity of kingdom in his ministers, 
yet, who does not make eyes at those ministers as he is doubtless of the kingdom which was once disrupted from 
his control, because, that kingdom is looked after well by the very same ministers, as such he is wallowing in 
promiscuity, such as he is, seeking the presence of such a Sugreeva, king of monkeys and an explicator, and even 
on winning his grace, he who is forthright regarding norms of ethics, an exceptional knower of subtleties of transactions 
and the rubrics of duty and time, that golden-tongued Hanuma, the son of Air-god, spoke sweet words that are reasonable, 
heart-pleasing, beneficial, pragmatic, profitable, impressive, immaculate, imperative, and impartial, and which 
words are also inclusive of care and concern of Hanuma, on making a determination with a belief that Sugreeva 
will pay heed to his words. [4-29-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9a]

"Acquired is the kingdom and glory as well, thus enriched is your dynastic prosperity, but foregathering friends 
is still remaining, and it will be apt of you to negotiate it. [4-29-9b, 10a]

"Indeed, he who really conducts himself punctually and amicably with friends, his kingdom, glory and valour will 
flourish. [4-29-10b, 11a]

"Matchless kingdom is his who can keep his treasury, army, friends and his own sovereignty - all these four, in 
equiponderance. [4-29-11b, c]

"Therefore, as the one with straightforward actions firstly you resort to an unimperilled course of action, lest 
any peril is imminent, and it will be apt of you to dutifully achieve the purpose of your friend Rama, for which 
alone Rama along with Lakshmana came to you, thus let your power preponderate. [4-29-12]

"Adversity thwarts him who comports himself with overenthusiasm only in self-indulgences, and who does not expeditiously 
strive for the sake of his friend leaving off all other activities of self-indulgence. [4-29-13]

"One who belatedly functions for the present mission of his friend, he will indeed be unassociated with that mission, 
despite of the fact that he has once performed great deeds in respect of the same friend. [4-29-14]

"Hence, the task of our friend is delayed, oh, enemy-destroyer, searching for Vaidehi is Raghava's mission and 
let it be done. [4-29-15]

"Though the time is lagging, oh, king, that insightful and punctual Rama is not indicating about it to you, though 
he is hurrying to complete his mission within a time-frame, because he is following you alone abiding under the 
control abiding by your promise. [4-29-16]

"Raghava is the cause for augmentation of multitudes, a long-lasting covenentor, and even an undefinable one in 
his proficiency, and an unparalleled one by his grace. [4-29-17]

"Certainly you have to carry through his mission as he has carried out your mission previously, and oh, lord of 
monkeys, it will be apt of you to summon worthy monkeys for searching Seetha. [4-29-18]

"As long as Rama is not going to prod us for action deem that there is no time lapse, but the minute he does deem 
it as lapsed. [4-29-19]

"You are a helpful one even to those that are unhelpful to you, oh, king of monkeys, then why repeat about him 
who helped you in getting your kingdom, and even in killing your enemy, Vali.

"Even if Rama did not help you in getting your kingdom and killing Vali you have to render your help to Rama, 
for you are a beacon of friendship and you are a helpful one without seeking any requital... then why you are 
delaying...[4-29-20]

"Highly adventurous and powerful vanara as you are, oh, lord of multitudes of monkeys and bears, why do you really 
temporise in issuing orders to fulfil the cherish of Rama. [4-29-21]

"If need be Rama of Dasharatha is really capable of keeping gods, demons and great-vipers under his control with 
his arrows, but he is anticipating fulfilment of your promise. [4-29-22]

"He fulfilled an exceptional cherish of yours without much doubting for the forfeiture of his own life, hence 
we search for his wife Vaidehi anywhere on earth or even on skies. [4-29-23]

"Gods cannot cause dismay to him, then gandharva-s - no; multitudes of wind-gods - no; asura-s - no; yaksha-s 
- no; and then wherefore the raakshasa-s can? [4-29-24]

"Therefore, oh, lord of monkeys, that Rama is energetic to exert himself, but he fulfilled your aspiration earlier, 
and it will be apt of you requite him with his aspiration at all events. [4-29-25]

"In case you were ordering us, oh, king of monkeys, among us whosoever he may be his impetus will be unhampered 
either in netherworlds, or in water, or up above on the sky. [4-29-26]

"Therefore command us, oh, merited one, as you have more than ten million unchallengeable monkeys under your command, 
as to who should start from where and for which purpose, and as to how one should exert himself." Thus Hanuma 
appealed to Sugreeva. [4-29-27]

On hearing the words of Hanuma that are validly demonstrated on time, Sugreeva whose soldiery is substantial, 
took a noble decision. [4-29-28]

And the noble minded Sugreeva directed Nila, one of the commanders of vanara army, and who always strives to foregather 
vanara army, to foregather all of the monkey-forces available in all the directions. [4-29-29]

"You have to have organise that way as to how my army in its entirety and from all over, together with corps commanders, 
is to be marshalled to stay in the cutting edge of army. [4-29-30]

"Those that are the quickstepped, venturesome fly-jumpers who are the defenders on the perimeter of army, they 
shall be fetched quickly an speedily at my order, and oh, Niila, you on your own have to personally and closely 
monitor the military establishment without any heterogeneity. [4-29-31]

"And, the monkey who arrives here after fifteen nights, to him termination of life is the punishment, there is 
no business for further adjudication. [4-29-32]

"Associated with Angada you shall approach elderly monkeys like Jambavanta and others, according to my decision 
and authorised by my order." Thus, Sugreeva, the king of best monkeys on assigning the set-up, and ordering Niila, 
the Commander of Vanara Forces, that glorious Sugreeva re-entered his palace-chambers. [4-29-33]

While Tara with a face that shines like the lord of stars is speaking thus, Vali dauntingly spoke to 
her with these words. [4-16-1]

"He is an younger brother and an adversary in particular, oh, pretty-faced Tara, can I by any reason 
tolerate him when he kept raving on frenetically, tell me. [4-16-2]

"To those valiant ones who neither give ground nor get assailed in wars, oh, shyly, endurance of a overweening 
war-whoop is more than death. [4-16-3]

"I am incapable of withstanding that dumbly Sugreeva's bawling commotion desiring a brawling duel. [4-16-4]

"Also, you need not bother about Raghava's doing some harm to me, as I wonder how a diligent man and 
knower of virtue can commit sin. [4-16-5]

"How do you follow me again, you return with all these females, truly you have expressed your friendliness 
owing to your devotion to me. [4-16-6]

"You may do away with your perplexity as I will retaliate Sugreeva on my going there only to drive him 
and his arrogance out, but without letting his lives loose. [4-16-7]

"As he is firmed up for a combat, I will indeed have to effectuate what his desire is, by caning with 
trees and fistfights, by which roughed up he returns. [4-16-8]

"My nerve and pace of combat will be insufferable to that malign minded Sugreeva, oh, Tara, you have 
offered your helping suggestion and you have shown all your friendliness to me, it is enough. [4-16-9]

"I adjured you on my lives, return with your followers, and I shall return to you on easily defeating 
and returning that 'brother of mine." Said Vali to Tara. [4-16-10]

She that pleasant articulator and talented Tara then hugged and circumabulated Vali, suppressing her 
moaning, as an honour to the braver. [4-16-11]

Then she who is a hymnodist that Tara has performed a hymnal bon voyage wishing triumph to Vali, and 
entered palace chambers along with other females, disoriented by her own sadness. [4-16-12]

On Tara entering her own palace chambers along with other females, Vali emerged out of the city hissing 
like an infuriated great snake. [4-16-13]

He that highly rancorous Vali suspired with high audacity and spread his sight everywhere intending 
to sight his enemy. [4-16-14]

Then that celebrated Vali saw Sugreeva who is in golden-ochre hue, whose girdle cloth is tightened for 
a fight, and who is with an air of self-confidence, blazing like fiery-fire. [4-16-15]

That strong armed Vali who is highly provoked has also tightened his girdle cloth on seeing proximately 
available Sugreeva. [4-16-16]

He that formidable Vali strongly tightening his girdle-cloth too, and proceeded towards Sugreeva in 
a well timed manner uplifting fists to fight him off. [4-16-17]

Even Sugreeva has come at that imprudent Vali with golden pendant, on tightening his fists, lifting 
them up at the ready, and aiming them well at Vali. [4-16-18]

Vali spoke this word to that Sugreeva who is swooping down on him, whose eyes are reddened in fury, 
and who is an expert and expeditious in fighting. [4-16-19]

"Properly clenching fingers this great fist of mine is firmly clenched, and it will unclench only on 
taking your lives when I pitch this on you at full speed." So said Vali threateningly to Sugreeva. [4-16-20]

Thus said, Sugreeva with high dudgeon said, "this fist of mine shall fall on your forehead plundering 
your lives." [4-16-21]

Coming near instantaneously Vali hit him, whereby Sugreeva is enraged and became like a mountain streaming 
blood in its torrents. [4-16-22]

But Sugreeva unhesitatingly uprooted a saala tree with his force and thrashed the limbs of Vali as with 
the thunderbolt thrashing a great mountain. [4-16-23]

But Vali when thwacked with saala tree had staggered and looked like a tossing ship in an ocean filled 
with heavy weight of merchandise and brimming with merchants, but on the brink of wrecking. [4-16-24]

Those two, Vali and Sugreeva, with their sensational energy, triumphing zeal, frightful physiques, swiftness 
as good as the Divine Eagle Garuda, vigilance in exploring perilous body parts of one another, ravagement 
of their own enemies fought frighteningly, like the sun and moon in the sky, which is inconceivable. 
[4-16-25, 26a]

But Vali being the possessor of might and vigour progressed and though greatly mighty is son of sun, 
Sugreeva, regressed. [4-16-26b, 27a]

Sugreeva became retardant in aggression when Vali routed his pride and then he exasperatedly started 
searching for Raghava to counteract Vali. [4-16-27]

Among those two there happened a deadly fight time and again using trees with branches, peaks of mountains, 
their own nails that are similar to the razor-sharp edges of thunderbolts, and with fists, knees, feet, 
and arms, like the fight that once chanced between demon Vritra and Indra. [4-16-28b, 29]

Those forest moving vanara-s that are soaked in blood have gone on clashing, threatening each other, 
like two clouds clashing uproariously. [4-16-30]

Raghava has then seen the lord of monkeys Sugreeva who is repeatedly eyeing all sides for help and who 
is even deteriorating in his enterprise. [4-16-31]

On seeing the lord of monkeys Sugreeva in a forlornness, then the refulgent and fearless Rama scanned 
for an arrow aiming to eliminate Vali. [4-16-32]

Then on tautening a venomous serpent like arrow in the bow, Rama started to draw out bowstring, whereby 
that bow attained a similitude with the Time-disc of the Terminator. [4-16-33]

At the blast of bowstring the lordly birds and animals are panicked, like those that will be startled 
by the approach of ear ending, and they all fled. [4-16-34]

The arrow released by Raghava that has the boom of thunderbolt's thunderclap and the flashes of a lightning 
fell on the chest of Vali. [4-16-35]

Hit by the fleetness of that arrow then that highly magnificent and intrepid lord of monkeys Vali fell 
onto the plane of earth. [4-16-36]

Like the flag that will be raised in honour of Indra during the month of ashvin on a full-moon day, 
but thrown onto earth along with its flagstaff after the festival, Vali with depleted energy and dissipated 
vitality slowly fell onto ground, and with tears blocking throat he moaned piteously. [4-16-37]

That best one among men Rama released a blazing and enemy subjugating arrow which in simile is like 
an Epoch-ender at the end of era, and that best arrow decorated in gold and silver looked like the glance 
from the Third-Eye of Rudra, emitting fire with smoke. [4-16-38]

That Indra's son Vali, dampened with blood and sweat, then looked like just felled Ashoka tree which 
has stemmed up and so far standing high on a mountain with fully bloomed clusters of its blood-red flowers, 
and when his anima is undone he even looked like the flagstaff on which a flag is raised in honour of 
Indra, but which is altogether dislodged and abandoned on the ground. [4-16-39]

Associated with Angada, Lt. Tara and others, the monkey Hanuma searched the caves
and thick forests of Vindhya Range. [4-50-1]

Hanuma has searched in the caves of that kingly Mt. Vindhya, which are jammed in
with lions and tigers, and even at the towering rapids. [4-50-2, 3a]

They reached the southwest peak of that mountain during their search and the time
set by Sugreeva swiftly lapsed while they are overstaying thereat that Mt. Vindhya alone.

Though that extensive province is indeed an unsearchable one with its impenetrable
caves and forests, yet Hanuma, the son of Air-god, searched everywhere on that mountain. [4-50-3b,
4]

Without pressing one another closely, yet not distancing from one another largely,
Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, also thus Mainda, Dvivida, and Hanuma, and even
Jaambavanta, crown prince Angada, also the forest-mover Lt. Tara have searched that province in
southern direction that is encompassed with interlocked mountains, and during their search there
they have observed a wide-opened and impassable cavity known as Riksha cavity which is well guarded
by a demon called Maya. [4-50-5, 6, 7, 8a]

Thirst and hunger invading them they are fatigued and craving for water, and such as
they are they beheld that capacious cavity which is enwrapped in climbers and trees. [4-50-8,
9a]

There they have seen the swans and the waterfowls like Kraunca, Saarasa, and even
Cakravaka waterfowls exiting from the cavity with their bodies drenched in water and reddened with
the dapples of lotuses' pollen. [4-50-9b, 10a]

When those best vanara-s have neared that fragrant and impermeable cavity they are
disheartened with amazement. [4-50-10b, 11a]

Though a suspicion in general is evoked in them, as they presumed that cavity to be
Naraka, The Hell of Yama, or Paataala, the Netherworld of Emperor Bali, those highly resplendent
and great mighty fly-jumpers have neared it, rejoicing for the availability of water in there.
[4-50-11b, 12a]

That hideous cavity is dispersed with diverse beings, similar to the residence of
the emperor of demons, namely Emperor Bali, in Paataala, the Netherworld, and it is unsightly and
impermeable from anywhere. [4-50-12b, 13a]

The son of Air-god Hanuma whose glossiness is like that of a mountaintop and who is
a mastermind in scrutinising every inscrutable forest, then spoke to all of the formidable
Vanara-s. [4-50-13b, 14a]

"We all have searched the southern quarter including those places that are enmeshed
with meshes of mountains, and we are overly fatigued, but Maithili is unnoticed. [4-50-14b,
15a]

"Swans along with waterfowls like Saarasa, Kruanca, and water drenched Cakravaka
birds are coming out of this cavity from all over, and even the trees available at its doorway are
verdant. Certainly there must be a wellspring, or otherwise a pond with water." Thus Hanuma spoke
to all monkeys. [4-50-15b, 16, 17a]

When Hanuma spoke to them thus as a kind of assurance, all those monkeys entered the
cavity and found it as a sunless or moonless cavity, enfolded in hair-raising darkness. [4-50-17b,
18a]

Those tigerly monkeys have also seen lions and various other animals and birds
exiting therefrom, and entered that cavity which is enshrouded in obscurity. [4-50-18b, 19a]

Their eyesight, or their vigour, or their valorousness is rendered ineffectual, and
their permeation is just like the directionless air as their eyesight is thwarted in
gloominess.

Despite of the gloominess of that cavity, unobstructed is their eyesight, or their
vigour or their valorousness, and their permeation is like that of the gust of air as their
eyesight is actuated even in darkness. [4-50-19, 20a]

But on their going further into that cavity speedily, those elephantine monkeys
beheld a best place that is luminous, as well as lovely. [4-50-20b, 21a]

In that awful cave that is compacted with various trees, then they advanced further
an interstice of yojana distance, hand in hand lest one may miss the other. [4-50-21b, 22a]

Though they are craving for water, highly perplexed, and lost track of their
destination or any waterway, and yet hopeful of their mission they unwearyingly hopped in that
cavity for a good while. [4-50-22b, 23a]

Those fly-jumpers are presently enervated and overly tired, and sad faced, and when
those brave ones are despaired of their life, just then they perceived a luminescence. [4-50-23b,
24a]

Those amenable monkeys on arriving at that province then beheld a shadowless
woodland with golden trees which in irradiance is like the irradiated Ritual-fire. They beheld
Saala, Taala [Palmyra,] Tamaala trees and some flowered trees like Punnaaga, Vanjula, Dhava,
Campaka, Naaga, also Karnikaara trees. The bunches of their flowers are golden and amazing,
leaflets are reddish, and like that the climbers enwreathing at their tops are like their towering
diadems and since those trees have golden fruits, they look as though decorated with golden
jewellery. Those golden-bodied tress are shining forth like tender sun and their pedestals are
completely studded with lapis gems. The birds encircling those trees are in the hue of lapis lazuli
gems. The lotus lakes are encompassed with golden lotuses with broad petals, which in shine are
similar to tender sun. [4-50-24b, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29a]

Then they beheld there the lotus-lakes containing serene waters and stocky lotuses
and burly fishes that are golden. [4-50-29b, 30a]

There the monkeys beheld choicest mansions everywhere made out of gold and silver,
some with golden and some with silver domes, while some with golden and some with silver
multi-stories, but all are studded with lapis gems with golden windows covered with laceworks of
pearls. [4-50-30b-32a]

They have also seen everywhere flowered and fruited trees that are similar in shine
to red corals and rubies, and golden honeybees, as well as honeys. [4-50-32b, 33a]

They beheld everywhere diverse and capacious beds and seats that are amazingly
crafted with gemstones and gold, and also stacks of utensils made of gold, silver and bell metal.
[4-50-33b, 34]

They saw the stockpiles of heavenly aloe vera substances and sandalwood sticks and
depurated eatables, tubers and fruits. [4-50-35]

They have also seen top-grade soft drinks, luscious honeys, heaps of finest quality
clothing, exotic blankets and sheaves of deerskins. [4-50-36, 37a]

Vanara-s have also observed mounds of undefiled gold stockpiled here and there
glowing with the glow of ritual fire. [4-50-37b, 38a]

When searching here and there in that cavity those valiant vanara-s of high
resplendence have perceived some lady rather not far from them. [4-50-38b, 39a]

They saw a sainted lady there who is attired in jute-cloths and who is on a
controlled diet and who is like a luminiferous entity by her own luminescence of asceticism.
[4-50-38b, 39a]

In wonderment the monkeys stood still all over, and in the matter of her identity
Hanuma asked her, "Who are you? Whose cavity is this, either? [4-50-40b, 40c]

Then Hanuma whose shine is similar to that of a mountain making palm-fold and
reverencing that aged lady asked, "Who are you? Whose is this cavity, or the mansion or these
jewels? Please speak." [4-50-41]

Tara with her visage that shines like the Lord of Stars, namely the Moon, then spoke to the son of queen Sumitra, 
namely Lakshmana, who while he is speaking is as though blazing with his own resplendence. [4-35-1]

"Let not this king of monkeys be addressed in this way, oh, Lakshmana, and he is not warranted to listen such 
tongue-lashing, especially from your tongue. [4-35-2]

"Sugreeva is not an unthankful one, oh, brave Lakshmana, a treacherous one - no; a flagitious one - no; an utterer 
of untruth - no; a duplicitous one, no, this king of monkeys is not even that. [4-35-3]

"Although he is a monkey this Sugreeva has not dismissed from his mind even the favour Rama has done in his respect, 
oh, valiant Lakshmana, which in combat is impractical for others. [4-35-4]

"By the beneficence of Rama, oh, the enemy-scorcher Lakshmana, now Sugreeva is privileged with reputation, everlasting 
kingship of monkeys, more so with Ruma and me as well. [4-35-5]

"Hitherto he has tolerated high anguish and on the attainment of this high comfort of kingship he has not oriented 
himself to the time-oriented actions as with saint Vishvamitra. [4-35-6]

"Oh, Lakshmana, that great-sage Vishvamitra clinging together with Ghritaachi, an angelic apsara, for a period 
of ten years, forsooth that virtue-souled sage regarded that period as one day. [4-35-7]

"When he who is a best one among the time-knowers, that great-resplendent Sage Vishvamitra himself is not privy 
to the occasioned time for a good many years, why talking about a commoner again. [4-35-8]

"He who is overwrought and now undergoing natural bodily appetites, oh, Lakshmana, and who is overtired as he 
is absolutely discontent in the concupiscence, such as Sugreeva is, it will be apt of Rama to bear with him for 
a while. [4-35-9]

"Without knowing realities, oh, young man Lakshmana, it will be extraneous of you to hastily enter into the control 
of your rancour like a commoner. [4-35-10]

"Men of your kind having conscientiousness, oh, best one among men, do not hurriedly rush in and get clutched 
by their own rancour, unconscionably. [4-35-11]

"I beg for your grace, oh, virtue-knower, in the interest of Sugreeva with all my equability, and you may dispel 
this clangour upshot in high dudgeon of yours. [4-35-12]

"In the honour of Rama, Sugreeva will disown his wife Ruma, even me, even Angada, why us, he will disown whole 
kingdom with its riches, food grains, livestock and whatnot, as I can infer. [4-35-13]

"On eliminating that worst demon Ravana, Sugreeva can bring Seetha together with Raghava, as with the coalescing 
of star Rohini with the Moon. [4-35-14]

"It is said that the demons in Lanka are a trillion, plus thirty-six thousands of units of military, where one 
unit consists of a ten-thousand warriors, and hundreds and thousands of other demons are there, thus they say. 
[4-35-15]

"Without eliminating those unassailable and guise changing demons, it is impracticable to eliminate him who has 
abducted Maithili, namely Ravana. [4-35-16]

"Oh, Lakshmana, it is impossible to kill those demons, or that Ravana, the evil-doer and abductor of Seetha, without 
any assistance, more so to Sugreeva... [4-35-17]

"This way Vali was saying and that king of monkeys is well-informed in these aspects, isn't it! But how Ravana 
mustered up these many troops is unclear to me, and I am saying what I heard from Vali. [4-35-18]

"Intending that assistance to you in war, best monkeys are hastened in all directions, to muster up very many 
best of the best monkeys. [4-35-19]

"Determined to achieve the objective of Raghava this king of monkeys Sugreeva has not bestirred himself while 
awaiting the return of those venturesome and very great mighty monkey-warriors who are sent out. [4-35-20]

"According to the well-organised groundwork earlier made by Sugreeva, oh, Saumitri, all of those great-mighty 
monkeys have to arrive here today itself. [4-35-21]

"Only today millions and millions of bears and hundredfold millions of baboons, and innumerable monkeys who by 
their own flare are like firebrands will arrive in your fore, oh, Lakshmana, thereby, oh, the enemy-repressor, 
therefore rebut your rage. [4-35-22]

"On staring at this angry face of yours, and on gazing at the angrily bloodshot eyes of yours, unsecured is the 
peace to the females of monkeys chief, and with the fear caused at first by Vali's elimination we are all indeed 
premonished about such a happening in respect of Sugreeva too. [4-35-23]

When those monkey commanders are relaxed after refreshments, then that sainted lady, who concentrates single-mindedly 
and who is a pursuer of probity, spoke this word to all of them. [4-52-1]

"Oh, vanara-s, if your enervation is eased off by devouring fruits, and if I may listen to that episode of yours, 
I wish to listen to it." Thus Swayamprabha addressed the monkeys. [4-52-2]

Hanuma, the son of Air-god, sincerely started to narrate their episode in its pithiness on hearing her words. 
[4-52-3]

"The king of all the world and one similar to Mahendra and Rain-god, such an illustrious Rama of Dasharatha entered 
Dandaka forest with his bother Lakshmana, even along with his wife Vaidehi, but Ravana coercively abducted his 
wife from Janasthaana. [4-52-4, 5]

"A valiant one and the king of important vanara-s known as Sugreeva is a vanara and the friend of that kingly 
Rama, and that vanara king expedited us. [4-52-6]

"He mobilised us along with these important vanara-s and Angada as helmsman to this southerly prospect, which 
is the walkabout of Sage Agastya and watched over by Yama, the Death-god, saying, 'you all shall collectively 
search for Seetha of Videha kingdom together with the demon Ravana, a guise-changer by his wish.' [4-52-7, 8]

"On searching out the southerly direction in its entirety we are all hungered and we all gathered around at a 
tree-stem. [4-52-9]

"All of us were whey-faced, all of us were preoccupied with propositions, thus deluged in the depthless deep of 
our despair we could not overreach the other shore of our oceanic despair. [4-52-10]

"Then straggling our eyes we perceived this wide cavity wrapped up with vines and woods and enwrapped in darkling. 
[4-52-11]

"Swans, water-hawks, saarasa-waterfowls were coming out of this cavity drenched in water and sprinkling drops 
of water with the flaps of their wings. [4-52-12]

"I said to all of them, 'Good! Let us enter it,' while they too had some inference about the availability of water 
in here. [4-52-13]

"As our task was hastening us then we all readied ourselves to fall in the cavity by tightly clasping each other's 
hand, and then we fell in this cavity. [4-52-14]

"Thus we readily entered this Black Cavity, and this much is our activity in here as we all have come here by 
our escapade for water, and we neared you when we were ravenous and retrogressing. [4-52-15, 16a]

"And we who are overly harassed by hunger have devoured the fruits and tubers you have offered with the grace 
of your hospitality. [4-52-16]

"You have rescued all of us who were on the verge of hunger-deaths, and what is to be done by vanara-s for you 
in requital that you may please tell." Thus Hanuma spoke to that sainted lady. [4-52-17b, 18a]

When she is spoken thus by those vanara-s then that omniscient Swayamprabha replied this to all of the vanara 
commanders. [4-52-18b, 19a]

"I am very happy with all of the mighty vanara-s and what I have done to you is a part of my conduct in equity, 
hence nothing need be done now in my favour, in the least. [4-52-9b, 20a]

When Hanuma is said that blessed word by that sainted lady in that way, that which is agreeable to propriety, 
then Hanuma said this sentence to her who is with an unreprovable discernment. [4-52-20b, 21a]

"We are now under the auspices of your ladyship comporting yourself in scrupulosity. We lapsed the time stipulated 
for us by the noble-souled Sugreeva by our roving around in this cavity. [4-52-21b, 22]

"Such as you are, a righteous lady, it will be apt of you to cross us over this cavity, as we have overextended 
the timeframe fixed by Sugreeva, whereby our longevity itself is threatened. [4-52-23]

"Oh, prudent lady, sail all of us through. We are rendered as hesitaters with the fear from Sugreeva. We still 
have to achieve an admirable achievement and that deed is also left undone as we are held-up in here." Thus Hanuma 
spoke to her. [4-52-24, 25a]

When Hanuma said thus that sainted lady said sentence, "I believe outgoing is impracticable for the incomers in 
aliveness from this cavity. [4-52-25b, 26a]

"By the sublime efficacy of ascesis acquired through my practices of numerous self-restraints I wish to sail all 
of the vanara-s through the incarceration, called this cavity. [4-52-26b, 27a]

"All of you best vanara-s shall close up your eyelids, for it is indeed impossible to attempt an exit with unclose 
eyes." Thus that sainted lady said to monkeys. [4-52-27b, 28a]

Then all of those desirers of departure are gladdened and immediately shut their eyelids, and further they lidded 
them with their delicately fingered hands. [4-52-28b, 29a]

She then sailed those noble souled vanara-s who covered their faces with their hands through that cavity barely 
within a minute. [4-52-29b. 30a]

That virtuous and sainted lady on comforting all of the monkeys, who are taken out of that precarious cavity, 
spoke this to them at the exterior of cavity. [4-52-30b, 31a]

"This one which is surrounded by diverse trees and vines is the magnificent Vindhya Mountain, this mountain is 
Prasravana, and this vast expanse of water is the southerly ocean. Now I wish to return to my mansion... oh, best 
vanara-s, let safety betide you." saying thus Swayamprabha the Sainted Lady, re-entered the ostentatious cavity, 
called Riksha Bila. [4-52-31b, 32]

Then that renowned Tara closely whiffed that face of monkey's king Vali and spoke these words to her 
dead husband. [3-23-1]

"Heedless of my word, oh, brave one, you are reposing miserably on a very rough and uneven ground spread 
with stones. [3-23-2]

"This earth must definitely be your beloved one, oh, best of monkeys, why because, you still embrace 
her while you recline on her, without replying me. [3-23-3]

"You have gone into the control of Sugreeva and Sugreeva alone triumphed, oh, brave one, oh, enthusiast 
in adventures, oho, is it fated to happen this way. [3-23-4]

"These chiefs of bears and monkeys are adoring you in every respect as their most worshipful one, and 
on hearing their despairing wailing, and the lamentation of Angada, and even these utterance of mine 
in keen, why do not you comeback to senses. [3-23-5, 6a]

"Do you wish to repose on the very daybed on which you have laid your enemies to rest when you have 
once felled them in fights, or what? [3-23-6b, 7a]

"Oh, successor of a clan with pristine calibre, oh, accorder of dignity, oh, devotee of fighting, oh, 
my dear, have you gone on leaving me without a protector and lonely? [3-23-7b, 8a]

"Really considerate fathers shall never propose brides to adventurers, they say. Yes! See me the wife 
of an adventurer, in a trice rendered as a war-widow left in the lurch. [3-23-8b, 9a]

"My honour is degenerated and my eternal happiness is disintegrated, and I am deluged in an abyssal 
boundless ocean called anguish. [3-23-9b, 10a]

"And dense with metallic substance is this heart of mine in its solidity, since it is not splintering 
into hundredfold even on seeing my husband killed, it is definite. [3-23-10b, 11a]

"By your nature you are my beloved, besides, you are a good-hearted one, more so, you are my husband, 
moreover, you are a valiant triumphing over your enemies in assaults, such as you are you have attained 
the fifth state, the death. [3-23-11b, 12a]

"Perhaps a woman might have mothered many children, and perhaps affluent with riches and crops, still 
people will call her a widow, if she is without husband. [3-23-12b, 13a]

"How do you repose now on a sheet of blood flowing from your own body, oh, brave one, as if you are 
reclining on your own bed spread with a bed sheet of red blood colour? [3-23-13b, 14a]

"I have no strength to closely embrace you with both my arms, oh, best fly-jumper, when the blood and 
dust covering your body comes in between. [3-23-14b, 15a]

"Single arrow released by Rama has doubly benefited Sugreeva in this highly deplorable enmity between 
you and Sugreeva, as his ambition to become the king is fulfilled and his fear from your persecution, 
too, is evanished. [3-23-15b, 16a]

"In vain, I have been watching you without a wink, on whom fatality has descended, as this arrow stuck 
in your chest is hindering me to embrace you..." Thus wailed Tara. [3-23-16b, 17a]

"Then the monkey chief Nila extricated that arrow which is stuck in the chest of Vali, as with the extraction 
of a firmly wedged sparkling snake from the cavity of a mound. [3-23-17b, 18a]

The sparkle of Rama's arrow while it is being extracted from Vali's chest is much the same as the sparkles 
of more brilliant sunrays that are extracted by the end of daytime, when the sun is sinking beyond the 
summit of dusky western mountain, and as contrasted with the hue of dusk. [3-23-18b, 19a]

The blood streams flown out of the gashes of Vali fell everywhere like the streams of water flowing 
from a mountain saturated with coppery mineral-ores. [3-23-19b, 20a]

On wiping off war dust with which her husband is muffled up, with tears gushing from her eyes she drenched 
that valiant one who is summarily hit by the missile of Rama. [3-23-20b, 21a]

On giving attention to all of the blood wet limbs of her slain husband that lady Tara spoke to her son 
Angada whose eyes are coppery-red. [3-23-21b, 22a]

"See the highly harrowing end time plight of your father, oh, son, he reached his end owing to the enmity 
harnessed by sinful deeds. [3-23-22b, 23a]

"To him, whose physical splendour vied with the dazzle of rising sun, to that father, king, and the 
accorder of honour you pay you last obeisance as he journeyed to the abode of Time-god." Thus Tara said 
to Angada. [3-23-23b, 24a]

When he is said so, Angada swiftly rose and touched the feet of his father with both of his rotund-shouldered 
sinewy arms saying, "father, I am Angada..." [3-23-24b, 25a]

"Why do not you bless Angada saying, 'long live, son...' when he is paying resects to you, as earlier?" 
Thus Tara is addressing Vali in her anguish. [3-23-25b, 26a]

"I am living through seeing the lifeless state of yours with the help of my son, no more than a helpless 
cow that sits near her bull with its calf, when that bull is slain by a lion, just now. [3-23-26b, c]

"How can you singly take the ultimate bath of a Vedic ritual after your conducting a ritual like combat, 
in the waters called bloodstreams caused by Rama's arrow, that too, when I, your wife, am available like 
a co-officiator of a Vedic ritual? [3-23-27]

"Now where is that treasured golden pendant of yours which the king of gods gave to you when he is satisfied 
with your conduct in wars, I don't see it? [3-23-28]

"Majesty is not deserting you even if your lives have departed, oh, accorder of dignity, as with the 
sunshine that departs the sun while he circumnavigates Mt. Meru, which mount is supposed to overshadow 
everything by its vastness. [3-23-29]

"Neither you heeded my word of expediency, nor I was indeed capable to forestall you, and I am doomed 
along with my son when you are exterminated in fight, whereby the Grace that forsook you, is deserting 
me too, in its entirety. [3-23-30]

When Lt Tara whose resplendence is similar to moonshine has spoken that way, then Hanuma deemed that Angada is 
laying siege to that kingdom of Vanaras. [4541]

Hanuma considered Vali's son Angada indeed as having eightfold intelligence, fourfold tactics, fourteen traits. 
[4542]

Angada who is steadily brimming over with his spiritedness, mightiness, valorousness, and waxing like the moon 
starting from day one of White Fortnight of a month, who is comparable to Brihaspati, the Jupiter, in sagacity, 
who mirrors up his father Vali in intrepidity, but who is now assiduously attentive to the rebellious teachings 
of Lt. Tara, like Indra who once listened to the unlistenable teachings of demon's mentor, namely Shukraacaarya, 
as that Angada is overly enervated to fulfil the concerns of the king Sugreeva. Then Hanuma who is the scholar 
in all scriptures started to confederate the confidence of Angada with the present regime of Sugreeva. [4543, 
4, 5]

Hanuma then rhetorically started to the schismatic secession of all those vanaras, who are desirous of avoiding 
Sugreeva and desiring a hideout, exemplifying the third ideation, namely the partition, among the four political 
ideations, viz., placation, presentation, partition, persecution. [4546]

When Hanuma made all of the vanaras to defect from Angada's idea of defecting Sugreeva, then Hanuma further overawed 
Angada with diverse and awesome orations containing the fourth ideation, namely the persecutory measures, employable 
by Sugreeva on defectors. [4547]

"As with your father you are undeniably abler in warfare, oh, the son of Lady Tara, and as with your father you 
are unquestionably capable enough to sustain the monkey kingdom." Thus Hanuma started to address Angada. [4548]

"Oh, best monkey, Angada, monkeys will be inconsistent at their will, isn't it! Separated from their sons and 
wives they cannot tolerate to remain under your control for a long. [4549]

"I plainly tell you what is obvious. This Jambavanta, these monkeys like Niila, and great monkey Suhotra and others 
do not definitely tagalong you, isn't it. Likewise I too do not definitely tagalong you. Such as we are, it will 
be impossible for you to sidetrack us from Sugreeva using tactics like placation, presentation or even persecution, 
isn't so! [45410, 11]

"Even if a mightless is at odds with the mighty he can linger on, so to speak, therefore guard yourself, for no 
mediocrity will be at odds... [45412]

"This matter of going underground into that Black Hole which you suppose as a hideout from Sugreeva, as you heard 
from Lt. Tara and others, but it is a deed of trifle to Lakshmana's arrows, not necessarily for Rama's arrows, 
in splitting apart whole of that Black Hole in a trice. [45413]

"Indeed, once Indra thudded his Thunderbolt on this very underground illusory place, but that act was indeed a 
trivial deed for that Thunderbolt made a single demonsized aperture to eliminate a single demon, Maya, which we 
now call <font color="#B3003A">Riksha bila,</font> Black Hole, nevertheless Lakshmana will splinter whole of this 
Black Hole with his acute arrows, as if it is leafy bowl. [45414]

"There are numerous ironarrows with Lakshmana that are kindred to Thunderbolt of Indra, whose punch will be equalling 
that of Thunderbolt and Lightning Flashes, and which are the splitters of mountains. [45415]

"As and when you settle down in that underground, more so, an unbefitting place for a crown prince, oh, enemyburner 
Angada, then and there all the monkeys will desert you resolvedly. [45416]

"Always sulking and reminiscing on their sons and wives, and hungered for the proximity of their kinfolk and hungered 
for diverse palatability as any monkey would cherish, even so, lamenting on the beds of lament they push you backwards. 
[45417]

"Devoid of goodhearted friends and wellwishing relatives, you will become highly sullen in solitariness. Such 
as you are you will end up as a highly frightened monkey, even from the shaking of a piece of straw.

"Devoid of goodhearted friends and wellwishing relatives, you will become highly sullen in solitariness. Such 
as you are you will end up as a highly frightened monkey and you will end up much the same as a seamy shaky piece 
of straw. [45418]

"By far, those fiercely frantic arrows of Lakshmana if targeted to kill you, in case you become a sidestepper 
from loyalties, will be terrifyingly twingeing. Further, those fierily frenetic arrows are irreversible. [45419]

"But, if you return to Kishkindha along with us, and if you obediently become Sugreeva's flanker, he establishes 
you only in kingdom as before. [45420]

"Your paternaluncle Sugreeva's gleam is his honesty as he is free of dishonesty, his desire is affection as he 
is free of aversion, his dedication is staunch as he is free of prevarication, and he himself is exoneration as 
he is free from exploitation, thus in no way he liquidates you. [45421]

"He is your mother's wellwisher, the strife of Sugreeva's life is for her only, more so, there is no other posterity 
to him than you. Oh, Angada, therefore go back to Kishkindha, rather than deflecting, deviating and deserting 
your own kingdom. [45422]

On hearing the well-spoken words of Sugreeva that expressed doubt about Rama's
valour, that great resplendent Rama took-up bow to inculcate credence in Sugreeva. [4-12-1]

Rama, the bestower of dignity to the sufferers, took up his dreadful bow, aimed at a
sala tree, and darted single arrow, by which all the directions reverberated with the twang of his
bowstring. [4-12-2]

The golden arrow released by the mighty Rama perforated all the seven sala trees,
and even the levelled areas of mountain, and then entered the earth. [4-12-3]

Thus that arrow which briskly drilled all the sala trees, came up in a moment from
under the earth, and again swiftly re-entered the quiver of Rama. [4-12-4]

On seeing them the seven sala trees that are profoundly fissured, that best monkey
Sugreeva went into a stunning astonishment at the rapidity of Rama's arrow. [4-12-5]

Highly gladdened Sugreeva made palm-fold in that astonishment, kneeled while his
ornaments dangled, and prostrated before Raghava with his head touching the ground. [4-12-6]

Overjoyed with that deed Sugreeva said this to that virtue-knower, the one who is
proficient among all experts of missiles, namely the valorous Rama, who is just in his presence
him. [4-12-7]

"You with your arrows, oh, best one among men, are capable of eliminating all the
gods including Indra, oh, lord, then why to speak of Vali. [4-12-8]

"By whom seven great sala trees, a mountain and also the earth is ripped off with
only one arrow, oh Kakutstha, who then can stand up to you in the vanguard of war. [4-12-9]

"Today on gaining a kind-hearted friend like you, who is similar to Indra and
Rain-god who accord favour on their own, my distress is gone and my joy is heightened.
[4-12-10]

"Oh, Rama, today itself you eliminate that enemy of mine in a brother's semblance
for my happiness, for which I adjoin my palms in supplication." Thus Sugreeva requested Rama.
[4-12-11]

That great percipient Rama embraced Sugreeva, which Sugreeva is pleasant in his look
for he gained confidence by now, and who is an alternate of Lakshmana to partake Rama's affection,
and then Rama said these words to such a Sugreeva in reply. [4-12-12]

""Let us quickly go from here to Kishkindha, oh, Sugreeva, you move in advance, and
on going there you invite that Vali, one redolent of your brotherhood." So said Rama to Sugreeva.
[4-12-13]

They all on quickly going to Kishkindha, the city of Vali, hedged themselves in the
thickets of forest trees and waited. [4-12-14]

Sugreeva firmly tightened his girdle-cloth for the duel and shouted boisterously for
the purpose of inviting Vali for a duel, and his rapidity in shouting appeared as though to crack
the sky. [4-12-15]

On hearing his brother's shouting that great mighty Vali is infuriated and
impetuously rushed out of his palace chambers, like the sun falling back onto sky from his dusking
brink. [4-12-16]

Then a very tumultuous and awful fight occurred between Vali and Sugreeva, which is
like the awful fight between the planets Mercury and Mars in skies. [4-12-17]

Those two brothers who are convulsed in frenzy battered each other in that fight
with their thunderbolt-like palms, and lightning-like fists. [4-12-18]

Then Rama wielding bow in his hand watched those valiant ones that are alike in
their appearance, like the Ashwin twins among gods. [4-12-19]

For which reason Raghava could not differentiate between Sugreeva or Vali, for the
same reason did not make up his mind to release his arrow, otherwise it would have been a deadening
arrow, as confusion is the only reason for Rama. [4-12-20]

Meanwhile Sugreeva is unable to spot out his benefactor Raghava as Vali whacked him
down, and thereby he immediately fled to Mt. Rishyamuka. [4-12-21]

Sugreeva is debilitated and enervated by Vali's thwacking till his limbs soaked in
blood, and he entered the great forest of Rishyamuka as Vali chased him. [4-12-22]

On seeing Sugreeva's entry into the forest of Rishyamuka, Vali said to him "you are
let off for now..." and saying so he returned to Kishkindha from there in view of fear from curse
of Sage Matanga. [4-12-23]

Raghava also came to that forest, along with his brother Lakshmana and along with
Hanuma, where that monkey Sugreeva fled. [4-12-24]

Seeing the arrival of Rama with Lakshmana, Sugreeva ashamedly turned his eyes down
to earth and piteously spoke this without eyeing Rama [4-12-25]

"Showing your dexterity you encouraged me to invite Vali for fight, but you got me
battered by my enemy, what is this done by you." [4-12-26]

"You should have truly made it known at that time only, oh, Raghava, that you will
not kill Vali, then I would not have come here, to Kishkindha. [4-12-27]

Rama replied that great-souled Sugreeva who is speaking woefully with pathetic words
in this way. [4-12-28]

"Sugreeva, by which reason I have not let-off an arrow such as that of mine, that
reason may be heard and let the anger be discarded. [4-12-29]

"By ornamentation, attire, physicality and movements, you and Vali look-alike.
[4-12-30]

"By your voice, bodily glow also thus in your looking, also in bravery and in
speech, oh monkey, I could not mark any difference. [4-12-31]

"Thereby, oh, great monkey, I have not released this great speeded and enemy
annihilating arrow of mine as I was confused in the similarity of your personalities. [4-12-32]

"I was ambiguous by your similarities, as such I have not released this ghastly and
life-taking arrow, otherwise the basic object of ours will be ruined, isn't it. [4-12-33]

"When my unawareness and fallacy hazardously afflicts none but you in the form of my
own arrow, oh, brave lord of monkeys, then I will be establishing my own imbecility and naivety,
isn't it. [4-12-34]

"Eliminating one who is protected means a terrifying sin of highest order, even so,
myself and Lakshmana and also thus Seetha with her exquisite glow are all dependent on you, and you
are our shelterer in this forest. [4-12-35, 36a]

"Therefore, oh, monkey, again you fight with him without doubting me, and I will
render him ineffective at this moment only with a single arrow of mine, and you can see Vali
squirming on the ground. [4-12-36, 37],

"You have an identification for yourself, oh lord of monkeys, by which you can be
identified when you are engaged in duel. [4-12-38]

"Lakshmana, pick up this gaja creeper that is beautiful in its appearance and let
this noble souled Sugreeva be garlanded with that." So said Rama to Lakshmana. [4-12-39]

Then Lakshmana plucked that gaja creeper with flowers growing at the foot of the
mountain, and slung it like a garland around the neck of that Sugreeva. [4-12-40] n

He that prosperous Sugreeva with that flowery-creeper adorning his neck then shone
forth like a black rain cloud against a backdrop of rich ochry colour of sunset, and with a train
of herons adorning that cloud like a garland. [4-12-41]

He that Sugreeva whose physique became effulgent by that creeper-garland is again
emboldened by Rama's words, and he again advanced to Kishkindha with Rama, and reached it again.

Hanuma on going from Mt. Rishyamuka to Mt. Malaya, has reported to the king of monkeys Sugreeva, about 
the two valiant Raghava-s. [4-5-1]

"Oh! great discerner Sugreeva, this is Rama... oh, stubbornly valiant Sugreeva, this virtuously valiant 
Rama arrived along with his brother Lakshmana... [4-5-2]

"Rama is the son of king Dasharatha, one born in Ikshvaku dynasty, an adept one in virtue and thus an 
adherent of his father's orders... [4-5-3]

"By whom the ritual fire is well worshipped in Vedic rituals like rajasuuya, ashvametha, and thus cows 
in hundreds and thousands are donated in those rituals, by whom this earth is ruled devoutly and truthful 
to his word, such Dasharatha's son is this Rama, who has to come to forests owing to a woman... [4-5-4, 
5]

"Ravana stole the wife of this principled one and great soul Rama when dwelling in forests, such as 
he is, he came seeking your refuge... [4-5-6]

"These two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, are interested to make friendship with you... thus you receive 
these two and worship them, for they are most venerable ones..." Hanuma thus advised Sugreeva. [4-5-7]

On hearing Hanuma's words Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys has become presentable and gladly spoke to 
Rama. [4-5-8]

"You are a trained one in treading righteous path, best by your scruples, and a kindlier one to all, 
so said Air-god's son Hanuma to me about your attributes, in subtlety... [4-5-9]

"Therefor oh, lord, you wish to make friendship with a monkey like me, thereby this is an honour and 
a best achievement to me alone... [4-5-10]

"If you aspire my friendship here I extend my arm, take this hand of mine into yours, thus let the convention 
be stably made fast..." Thus Sugreeva proffered friendship to Rama. [4-5-11]

Rama is gladdened at heart on listening all those words well said by Sugreeva, and then clutched Sugreeva's 
hand in his, and ardently abiding by the vow of friendship he embraced Sugreeva, grippingly and happily. 
[4-5-12, 13a]

Then the destroyer of enemies Hanuma discarding the guise of ascetic assumed his original monkey form, 
and on producing fire with two sticks then made it to glow. decorated, worshipped with flowers, then 
gladly and devoutly placed that fire in between Rama and Sugreeva. [4-5-13b,14,15a]

Then those two performed circumambulations to that well glowing ritual fire, and thus, Rama and Sugreeva 
entered into the pact of friendship. [4-5-15, 16a]

And then gladdened at heart are those two, that monkey and Raghava, gazed enough at each other eye-to-eye, 
but their hearts did not derive any fraternal satisfaction. [4-5-16b, 17a]

Sugreeva rejoicingly said to Raghava, "you are the amiable friend of mine, henceforth our mirth or miseries 
are same for us..." [4-5-17b, 18a]

And then Sugreeva snapped off and spread a fully flowered tree-branch of sala tree with many leaves, 
and sat on it along with Rama. [4-5-18b, 19a]

Then Hanuma the son of Air, gladly gave a well-flowered branch of sandalwood tree to Lakshmana... [4-5-19b, 
20a]

Then that delighted Sugreeva with his sweet words, and with his eyes quavering in happiness, replied 
Rama softly. [4-5-20b, 21a]

"Rama, I am ridiculed, stolen is my wife, I move here about in these forests with dread and fear haunting 
me... I took refuge in this impenetrable forest... [4-5-21b, 22a]

"Oh, Raghava, my brother denounced me, he even made me an enemy of his, such as I am I am living in 
these forests with scare and fear, and with dismayed vitality... [4-5-22b, 23a]

"Oh, highly fortunate Rama, affirm fearlessness to me from Vali by who I am highly intimidated, and 
as to how there will be fearlessness to me from him, it will be apt of you to accomplish that, that 
way... [4-5-23b, 24a]

When thus said, that resplendent and righteous one being the patron of virtue Rama replied Sugreeva, 
as though laughing off. [4-5-24b, 25a]

"A friend is the resultant factor of helpfulness... that I know... oh, great monkey I intend eliminate 
that Vali, the abductor of your wife... [4-5-2b, 26a5]

"Unfailing are these arrows of mine, scorchers like sun, sharp ones tied with eagle feathers, similar 
to Indra's Thunderbolts, sharp are their point and straight is their egress, similar to enraged snakes, 
and these arrows of mine will be speeded up to fall on that vicious Vali... [4-5-26b, 27, 28a]

"You will see now itself the falling of Vali like a splintered mountain onto ground, when completely 
ruined by these cruel arrows that are similar to venomous snakes..." Thus Rama inculcated confidence 
in Sugreeva. [4-5-28b, 29a]

On hearing Raghava's words that are appeasing for his self, Sugreeva is very completely satisfied and 
said this fine sentence. [4-5-29b, c]

"By your grace, oh, lion among men, let me regain my wife and kingdom too... oh, god of humans, as to 
how he does not suffer me again, thus you may please make happen... let not my elder brother turned 
as an enemy of mine suffer me again... [4-5-30]

During the friendly conversation of Rama and Sugreeva, the left eyes of Seetha, Vali and Ravana that 
bear similitude with lotuses, golden orbs, and fireballs respectively have fluttered equally. [4-5-31]

With his life-force slowing down Vali respired slowly glancing everywhere, and he
firstly saw his brother Sugreeva afore him. [4-22-1]

Vali nodding at Sugreeva, who achieved triumph and became the lord of fly-jumpers,
amicably spoke this to him in an unambiguous tone. [4-22-2]

"Sugreeva, reckon me not by my iniquities, but reckon as one who is all the while
forcibly hauled into this futurity owing to my impropriety and obduracy. [4-22-3]

"I do not think that we two are fated to share blissfulness simultaneously, oh, boy,
therefore the amity seemly to brothers has cropped up otherwise. [4-22-4]

"You realize that I am going to the abode of Time-god now itself, and hence propose
yourself as king of this forest-dweller's kingdom, now itself. [4-22-5]

"Such as I am, I am indeed forgoing my life, kingdom, and this immense prosperity
and even the unenviable glory which adduces that 'Vali is unkillable,' right away. [4-22-6]

"Oh, valiant Sugreeva, it will be apt of you to make happen the word I am going to
say even in such a situation in which now I am, and oh, king, even if that word of mine is
infeasible. [4-22-7]

"Have a look at this Angada, who is privileged for all happiness, brought up in all
comforts, though a boy he is mannerly, and who with his tear-filled face fallen onto ground.
[4-22-8]

"More dear than my own lives is my son, and when he is deprived of me you have to
foster him as if he is your own son, with no resources becoming sparse in every way. [4-22-9]

"Oh, king of fly-jumpers, as with me you too are his father, patron, an overall
protector from all sides, and also thus an assurer in fear. [4-22-10]

"This admirable son of Tara is a coequal of yours in triumphs, and in eliminating
those demons he will be in your advance guard. [4-22-11]

"This mighty and sinewy son of Tara is youthful, and on overtaking in war this
Angada will undertake actions seemly for a son of mine. [4-22-12]

"In deciding meanings in all their subtleties and also in presages of diverse nature
this daughter of Sushena, Tara, is an insightful one in every way. [4-22-13]

"Whatever is said by her as proper that is doable indubitably, indeed nothing
contrary happens to her opinions, in the least. [4-22-14]

"You have to accomplish Raghava's mission undoubtedly, and if it is unaccomplished
there will be infraction on your part because you befriended him before an altar of fire, and you
may even be punished for dishonouring him and your given word to him. [4-22-15]

"The bounteous goddess of triumph ensconced in this golden pendant will completely
leave it off on my death, avoiding the flaw of touching a corpse, isn't it... hence oh, Sugreeva,
you wear it." Thus Vali spoke to Sugreeva. [4-22-16]

Thus, that way when Vali spoke to Sugreeva with brotherly kind-heartedness, Sugreeva
again waned away forgoing his spiritedness, like the lord of stars, namely the Moon, when eaten
away by the planet, namely Rahu, during lunar eclipse. [4-22-17]

Quietened by Vali's words and conducting himself befittingly and attentively in the
given situation, Sugreeva has then taken that golden chain only when Vali authorised him.
[4-22-18]

On giving away that golden pendant, and on seeing his son who is available nearby,
readying himself towards his end that is setting in, Vali affectionately spoke to Angada.
[4-22-19]

"From now on, observing time and place you have to tolerate pain or pleasure, endure
mirth or misery on your going under the control of Sugreeva. [4-22-20]

"Oh dextrous Angada, as to how I have entertained you in whichever way you conducted
yourself with me, Sugreeva may not approve of such a puerile behaviour of yours, if you resort to
it. [4-22-21]

"Do not reach at his unfriendly ones, nor come near his enemies, oh, enemy-destroyer
Angada, you shall be in the control of Sugreeva attending to the purposes of your lord with
self-control. [4-22-22]

"Do not conduct yourself with excessive friendliness or unfriendliness, as this pair
of opposites itself has a flaw, therefore you cultivate an intermediary outlook." Vali thus spoke
to Angada. [4-22-23]

He who is highly tortured by the arrow of Rama spoke to Angada in that way, and
afterwards his eyeballs rolled-up, mouth hung open baring his horrid teeth, and his life too took
to flight from his body. [4-22-24]

Then, all those best monkeys avaialble there have started to weep when their monkey
chief is dead, and for that matter they have loudly squawked at his death in this way.
[4-22-25]

"When the lord of monkeys departed to heaven Kishkindha is indeed rendered derelict,
dreary are the gardens, deserted are the mountains and forests as well, and when the tiger among
fly-jumpers is dead all the vanara-s are rendered up into a lacklustre life. [4-22-26, 27a]

"And by the impetus of whose great rapidity flowers available in forests and
woodlands used to shower on him in torrents and enwreathe him from behind, that Vali is no more,
and now who has got such an impetus? [4-22-27b, 28a]

"By which great-souled Vali a ferocious duel was given to the celestial, namely the
great armed Golabha, which did not cease either in the daytime or night till Vali felled Golabha,
that Vali is no more. [4-22-28b, 29]

"Thereafter, in the sixteenth year Vali unquestionably felled Golabha, and on
killing that evil-minded Golabha with his zigzag teeth Vali accorded fearlessness to all of us, how
such a Vali is felled now?" Thus the monkeys raised hue and cry. [4-22-30]

But when that fly-jumper's brave lord Vali is killed, those fly-jumpers have gone
into a freneticness in that matter of Vali's killing, as with the cows becoming frenetic when their
husbanding bull is killed while moving in a great forest that is riddled with a lion. [4-22-31]

But then Tara, whelmed under a ocean called affliction closely observed her dead
husband's face, embraced him and collapsed onto ground as with any creeper plant when the giant
tree on which it is hinging is hacked down. [4-22-32]

That righteous Rama readying his great bow decorated with gold, and on taking blazing sun similar arrows 
that are victory-oriented in wars, proceeded from Rishyamuka along with Sugreeva to the city ruled by 
the valour of Vali, namely Kishkindha. [4-13-1, 2]

Stern-necked Sugreeva and the great mighty Lakshmana strode ahead of that great soul Rama. [4-13-3]

The brave Hanuma, dauntless Nala and Neela, and the captain of monkey's captains Tara of great energy 
followed them rearward. [4-13-4]

They moved on looking at the trees that are drooping with the weight of their flowers, and at he rivers 
that are carrying pleasant water while themselves are coursing towards ocean. [4-13-5]

They on seeing house-like caverns, crags, ravines and caves, and monumental peaks, cavities that are 
pleasant for sight have moved on. [4-13-6]

On their way they observed lakes that are glistening forth with gem-like waters without slime, and with 
lotus buds in budding stage. [4-13-7]

Those lakes are reverberant with Karandava-s, Saarasa-s, Swans, Vanjula-s and other waterfowls, also 
like that with Chakravaaka-s and other birds. [4-13-8]

They have seen fearless deer feeding on soft grass blades everywhere, somewhere moving here and there 
in the forest, and else where standing. [4-13-9]

They have also seen the forest elephants that have white tusks for their ornaments and that are moving 
in herds, and which are the dangerous enemies of lakes as they destroy lakebeds. [4-13-10]

Also seen are the vigorous and elephantine monkeys that are like mobile mountains, begrimed with dust, 
and bellowing on mountain ridges. [4-13-11]

On seeing other forest beings in that forest and birds moving aloft in sky, those followers of Sugreeva 
quickly moved on. [4-13-12]

While they are quickly going, Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, saw there a clump of forest trees 
and he asked Sugreeva like this. [4-13-13]

"This cluster of trees surrounded with plantain trees is like an accumulation of thick clouds, and this 
is shining forth like a cloudscape in sky. [4-13-14]

"What is this? I wish to know and oh, friend, I wish you to clear this inquisitiveness of mine. [4-13-15]

On hearing that sentence of that great soul Raghava, then Sugreeva described about the significance 
of that forest while proceeding on the way. [4-13-16]

"Raghava, this spacious hermitage with abundant gardens and dainty tubers, fruits and water is a weary 
remover." Thus Sugreeva started telling Rama. [4-13-17]

"There were hermits named <em>sapta jana</em>, Seven Persons, who were dourly vowed 
with their heads pendulous downward and legs up, as in <em>shiirSa aasana</em> , 
the upside-down yogic body posture, and who always reclined in water. [4-13-18]

"They were making diet on air alone that too once in seven days, and living unwaveringly in that way 
they practised their asceticism for seven hundred years and went to heavens with their bodies. [4-13-19]

"This hermitage that has encircling trees for its compound wall has become highly unassailable even 
for Indra together with all gods and demons. [4-13-20]

"Birds and other forest moving animals forbear this hermitage and those that unknowingly enter in there 
they do not return. [4-13-21]

"From there artistically worded lyrical and instrumental tunes, and even the sounds of ornaments are 
audible, and oh, Raghava, one can sense a divine fragrance too. [4-13-22]

"Even the triadic ritual-fires glow there, and their thick and ochry coloured smoke like that of a reddish-brown 
pigeon is apparent muffling the treetops. [4-13-23]

"When that smoke is mantling their tops these trees are beaming forth like mountains of gems overlaid 
with clusters of clouds. [4-13-24]

"Offer salutations determinedly and adjoining palms addressing the sages called Seven Persons, oh Raghava, 
along with brother Lakshmana [4-13-25]

"Those that offer salutations to those sages with contemplated souls will evince no bodily trauma in 
the least." Thus said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-13-26]

Then Rama along with brother Lakshmana adjoined palms, addressed himself to the great-souled sages known 
as Seven Persons, and offered salutations to them. [4-13-27]

That righteous Rama along with brother Lakshmana, Sugreeva and other monkeys having worshipped those 
sages proceeded to Kishkindha well-pleased at heart. [4-13-28]

Having gone a long way from that hermitage of Seven Persons they have seen that unassailable and Vali 
ruled city namely Kishkindha. [4-13-29]

Then Rama's bother Lakshmana, Rama, and other monkeys wielding their weapons and flaring with their 
upsurged fiery again came to eliminate that enemy Vali to the city that is ruled by the brawn of the 
same Vali, the son of Indra. [4-13-30]

On seeing her husband felled to ground with a terminator like arrow released by
Rama, that resentful lady Tara whose face is lovely like the moon, reached and embraced him.
[4-20-1]

Tara is agonised when she saw the elephantine and mountainous vanara, namely Vali,
reduced to no more than an uprooted tree, and she wailed fretfully with grief scorching heart.
[4-20-2b, 3]

"Oh, stern one in fights, oh, victorious one, oh, best valiant, oh, best flier, I
have never blamed you either in your presence or in your absence, why do not you talk to me now?
[4-20-4]

"Arise, oh, tigerly monkey, you have to make use of a best bed as best kings will
not on repose on soil in this way, isn't it. [4-20-5]

"The earth seems to be a highly cherished darling of yours, oh, lord of the land, as
you still embrace her with your limbs leaving me off, even when your lives are drained.
[4-20-6]

"It is evident that you, who conduct yourself righteously, must have built a
Kishkindha-like delightful city in the pathway to heaven by your leaving lovely Kishkindha.
[4-20-7]

"You bring an end to the pleasure trips you made along with us in the sweet smelling
forests from time to time by your departing. [4-20-8]

"When this fifth state betiding you, oh, great chief of chiefs of monkeys, I am
dejected, despaired and drowned in the sea of sadness. [4-20-9]

"My heart is very sturdy - perhaps, even on seeing you slain and fallen to ground,
it is not splintering now into thousand splints, though it is tormented by sorrow. [4-20-10]

"By which reason you have snatched away Sugreeva's wife, oh, chief of fliers, and
even expelled him from Kishkindha, that is the reason why you got this result. [4-20-11]

"I am she who said a beneficial word to you with an interest in your well-being and
wishing your welfare, but oh, best monkey, you unmindfully brushed me off. [4-20-12]

"Oh, endower of honour, apsara-s, the celestial dancers, will be proud of their
beauty, youthfulness, and expertise in romance, and oh, honourable one, you can stir up their
hearts towards you by your gallantry, definite is that. [4-20-13]

"The Time which is an undoubtable factor in respect of anybody has ended your life,
definite is that, and that Time alone perforce brought you, who are otherwise an uncontrollable
force, to the control of Sugreeva.

The Death / Time no doubt has a concern with anyone for it is the ender of life, and
definitely it chanced upon you by the capability of Sugreeva in getting support of Rama, and
Sugreeva alone controlled you, who are otherwise an uncontrollable force. [4-20-14]

"Rama's killing Vali when he is fighting with another is unbefitting in its method,
and he too is not at all worried for doing such a highly deplorable deed. [4-20-15]

"So far I am not doleful or saddened, but now as a desolate seethed by sorrow I have
to undergo widowhood and dolefulness. [4-20-16]

"My Angada is raised fondly, a brave one with gracefulness and one who is accustomed
to comforts, but which will be the predicament he has to undergo when his paternal-uncle Sugreeva
gets into a fit of fury. [4-20-17]

"Oh, son Angada, clearly see your father, a patron of virtue, oh, boy, later it is
impossible to catch a glimpse of him." Thus Tara said to her son Angada. [4-20-18]

"You have started towards other world, isn't it, so reassure your son, kiss goodbye
on his forehead, and give me your parting messages." So said Tara to Vali. [4-20-19]

"Really, Rama has not only done a great deed of hitting you down, but he also
achieved indebtedness towards Sugreeva, both in a single promise. [4-20-20]

"Now, you are to your heart's content Sugreeva as you regain your wife Ruma, you may
even wallow in the kingdom unworriedly as your enemy-brother is silenced." So said Tara to
Sugreeva. [4-20-21]

""Oh, lord of monkeys, why do not you talk to me, the dear wife of yours, when I am
prattling at length, by the way, several of your comely wives are here, they are here, see them."
Thus Tara lamented. [4-20-22]

On listening Tara's lamentation the vanara females that are around became plaintive,
saddened pitiably and wept piteously embracing Angada. [4-20-23]

"Oh, one with bracelets on your mighty arms, why you are going to an eternal abode
leaving your dear son Angada? Your going away leaving such a son, who possesses best aptitudes that
comes close to your abilities, and the one who always wears an exquisitely pleasant getup, is
unbefitting. [4-20-24]

"If I have done any undesirable deed in an indiscriminate way, even in the least, I
may be pardoned for that, and here I bow down at your feet... oh, masterful one... oh, the lord of
monkeys lineage... oh, brave one... [Thus Tara wept for Vali.] [4-20-25]

That Tara with her unblemished complexion is seated in the close proximity of her
husband along with other vanara females, and weeping pitiably in that way, she decided to
self-immolate, and thus she flounced down onto ground where Vali is slouching. [4-20-26]

On seeing them the wielders of best weapons and audacious ones, two brothers and great souls, namely 
Rama and Lakshmana, Sugreeva became ambiguous. [4-2-1]

Distressed at heart that foremost monkey gazed blankly in all directions and he did not remain at any 
one place. [4-2-2]

On seeing those two great mighty ones that monkey has not even made-up his mind steadfast as he is very 
much frightened, and his heart is really sunken. [4- 2- 3]

He that righteous Sugreeva considering his own strength and weakness is much agitated, and along with 
all the other monkeys too are frightened. [4-2-4]

On seeing Rama and Lakshmana then that chief of monkeys Sugreeva with much dreadfulness said this to 
his ministers. [4- 2- 5]

"Here they come wearing jute cloths and move about in this impassable forest deceitfully, definitely 
Vali must have dispatched them... [4-2-6]

Then on seeing the great archers Rama and Lakshmana the ministers of Sugreeva have gone from that mountain 
terrace to another high-peaked mountain. [4- 2- 7]

Then the group-leaders of monkeys quickly arrived as they fled, at that lofty monkey group-leader Sugreeva, 
the chieftain of monkeys, gathering around him there they stood at his nearby. [4-2-8]

Thus they reached to one course of return, after hopping from one mountain to the other, shuddering 
mountains and even thir peaks by their trample in hastiness. [4-2-9]

Then all of the tree-branch animals, who are great in their strength, have wrecked down the well-flowered 
trees that are clumped in that forest on that mountain by their swinging. [4- 2- 10]

While those best monkeys hopped everywhere they have frightened deer, wildcats and tigers on that great 
mountain. [4-2-11]

Then the ministers of Sugreeva, assembled on that best mountain and gathered around the chief of monkeys 
Sugreeva, and all stood with their adjoined palms. [4-2-12]

Then Hanuma, the ablest sentence-maker, said this sentence to Sugreeva who is dismayed with fear doubting 
Vali's mischief. [4-2-13]

"Perplexity be warded off... all of you discarded that great fear from Vali or his cruelty... there 
is no scare from Vali here on this best mountain, for it is Mt. Malaya... [4-2-14]

"By whom you are bewildered at heart and running away, oh, the best monkey Sugreeva, I do not see that 
cruel-looking, cruel Vali here... [4- 2-15]

"From whom your fear is spurted, oh, gentle Sugreeva, that elder brother of yours, who is an evildoer 
and the one with harmful intent... that Vali is not here. Therefore I perceive no fear from him...[4-2-16]

"Aha! You made a monkey of yourself, oh, monkey, and you feel small, thus you are not able to stay firm 
in your mind by that fickleness, and your monkeyshines is clear by it... [4-2-17]

"Keep your intellect and wisdom firm, and express all your intents rightly in your body language in 
all your undertakings... certainly, a king getting into unintelligence cannot command all his subjects..." 
So said Hanuma to Sugreeva. [4-2-18]

Sugreeva thus hearing entirely to all the propitious words of Hanuma spoke to Hanuma this opportune 
sentence, positively. [4-2-19]

"Lengthy are their arms, broad are their eyes and they are the wielders of arrows, bows and swords... 
and on seeing them, to whom there will be no scare? These two are like the sons of some divinity..." 
Sugreeva thus spoke to Hanuma. [4-2-20]

"I presume these two... those best of men are abetted by Vali to assault me... for, the kings like Vali 
do have many friends and trusting them absolutely is an unpardonable mistake... [4-2-21]

"By men the enemies are to be assessed... for, they move in disguise and distrustful enemies will trounce 
the complacently self-assured ones that relax in their own self-confidence on any possible occasion... 
[4-2-22]

"In exploits Vali is an ingenious one... and the kings will be observing many aspects of their enemies 
to eliminate them... and they the kings are to be known even by ordinary people... [4- 2- 23]

"Begone to them oh, monkey Hanuma, in a commoner's form, for your monkey-hood is distinguishable by 
Vali's agents, and know the intentions of those two by their conduct, by their semblance, and by their 
conversation, as well...[4-2-24]

"Aim at their concepts and if they are pleasant-hearted, duly create confidence in them by conducting 
yourself, and also commending them again and again... oh, best of monkeys, Hanuma, set their face towards 
me alone in a compassionate manner, and you inquire about the reason of their entering this forest alone... 
of those bows wielders... [4-2-25, 26]

"You shall know whether those two are clean at heart or otherwise, or about their evil-mindedness or 
otherwise by conversation..." Thus Sugreeva said to Hanuma. [4-2-27]

Thus this way ordered by Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, Hanuma, the son of Air-god made up his mind 
to go there, where Rama and Lakshmana are. [4-2-28]

That marvellous monkey Hanuma agreeing for the words of that inaccessible and very much frightened Sugreeva, 
and on respectfully replying him saying that, 'I will do accordingly...' proceeded there where that 
highly mighty Rama is there along with Lakshmana. [4-2-29]

That great vanara king Vali who is sprawling agonised by arrow, and to whom Rama gave a reply with well-reasoned 
words did not find any other reply to be given to Rama. [4-19-1]

He who is heavily thrashed with trees, whose limbs are variously cracked with boulders, and whom Rama's 
arrow finally vanquished, that Vali fainted at the time of his breathing his last. [4-19-2]

Tara, wife of Vali, heard that the tigerly monkey Vali perished in fight by the arrow released by Rama.

On hearing the very gruesome killing of her husband that is unpleasant, she is highly anguished and 
rushed out of Kishkindha along with Angada. [4-19-4]

On seeing Rama with bow those very mighty vanara-s that form the escort of Angada are scared to death, 
and they very quickly fled from there towards Kishkindha. [4-19-5]

Then on her way towards field of combat she saw the monkeys that are frightened and fleeing in disorder, 
like those animals that have wandered off from their herd when their master is killed. [4-19-6]

Nearing those monkeys that are already distressed at the fall of Vali, and that are highly frightened 
by Rama, and that are fleeing as though Rama's arrow is still tracking them down, Tara spoke to all 
of them, distressed as she is. [4-19-7]

"Oh! Vanara-s, what for you are running away in utter fright and desperation, leaving off your best 
king to whom all of you are ushers?" Thus Tara enquired with the monkeys. [4-19-8]

"Whether or not a cruel brother made his brother to fall for the reason of kingdom with the arrows of 
Rama which can surge well from distance and fall on distant target? Aver it. [4-19-9]

On hearing the words of monkey's wife those guise-changing monkeys spoke this sentence coherently to 
lady Tara, befitting to present time of chaos. [4-19-10]

"Return, oh, lady with a living son, and safeguard Angada, for the Terminator in the form of Rama is 
taking away Vali on killing. [4-19-11]

"Shattering trees and massive boulders that Vali hurled at him with thunderbolt like arrows Rama felled 
Vali as if by thunderbolt. [4-19-12]

"When that tigerly fly-jumper Vali whose brilliance is similar to Indra is killed all this vanara force 
felt defenceless and fled. [4-19-13]

"Let the city of Kishkindha be safeguarded and let Angada be anointed, and when Vali's son Angada is 
enthroned all the fly-jumpers will stand by him. [4-19-14]

"Or, your staying here is not good, oh, one with a pleasant visage, for those monkeys of Sugreeva will 
promptly enter our strongholds on this day itself. [4-19-15]

"There are foresters in Kishkindha, some with wives and some without, some hankering after wives, some 
whom we have victimised, and from them we have very great danger." So said monkeys to Tara. [4-19-16]

On going a small distance ahead after listening those words, she whose smile will be winsome, that lady 
Tara said this befitting to her personality. [4-19-17]

"Of what avail is a son, or a kingdom, or I to myself when my husband that lion like monkey with great 
honour perished. [4-19-18]

"I wish to consign myself at the base of foot of that great-soul, who is felled down by the arrow projected 
by Rama." So said Tara to fleeing monkeys. [4-19-19]

Saying thus she started to wail and convulse in agony, and slapped her head and chest with both of her 
hands while she speedily rushed towards Vali. [4-19-20]

While she is still trudging then she saw her husband who is the destroyer of arch-demons like Maayaavi 
and Dundubhi, and who never retreated in combats, but now fallen down on ground. [4-19-21]

She saw Vali who is a flinger of loftiest mountains as with Indra flinging his thunderbolt, who is a 
blaster as with great gusty winds, and who is a roarer as with a cluster of great black-clouds. [4-19-22]

He who equals Indra in the invasion of enemies, a violent thunderer at the opponent thunderers, a brave 
one felled by still brave one, and who is like a best animal killed by a tiger for the purpose of flesh, 
and quietened like black-cloud at the end of downpour, At him she saw. [4-19-23]

He who is like a sanctum that is hitherto worshipped by all people, that is decorated with flags and 
demarcated with podia, but just ravaged by an eagle for the sake of a snake which sneaked into that 
sanctum, and Tara saw such a Vali plumped on the ground. [4-19-24]

She saw Rama standing and abutting on his very powerful bow, and his younger brother Lakshmana, even 
at the younger brother of her husband, namely Sugreeva. [4-19-25]

Going past them she reached her husband who is routed in combat, and on observing him closely she indeed 
fell down on earth as she is distraught and dumbfounded. [4-19-26]

On getting up as though reawakened from sleep she saw her husband bound fast by the strings of death, 
and then she wailingly addressed him as, "oh, nobleman's son..." [4-19-27]

On observing her who is wailing like a female osprey, and even on looking at Angada who arrived there, 
a miserable remorse came upon Sugreeva. [4-19-28]

When the great-souled Lakshmana spoke to Sugreeva in this way, Sugreeva spoke this
word to Hanuma who is available at his side. [4-37-1]

"Convoke the Vaanara-s available on the summits of these five mountains, namely Mt.
Mahendra, Mt. Himalaya, Mt. Vindhya, and Mt. Kailash and those that are on the whitish peak of Mt.
Mandara. As well as those that are on the mountains at seashore, <font color="#B3003A">udaya

youthful sun. And them that are on the mountains which shine in the ochry hue of evening clouds,
<font color="#B3003A">asta adri</font>, namely 'sunset-mountain' and which mountains are situated
at the Palace of Sun. And the catastrophic monkey chiefs that are abiding in the palm groves of Mt.
Padma. Also thus, the fly-jumpers who are similar to black-mascara and black-clouds in their shine,
and who match elephants in their vigour, and who live on Mt. Anjana, they too are to be convened.
Those fly-jumpers whose complexion will be golden and dwell in the caves of Great-Mountain, besides
those who are on the mountainsides of Mt. Meru, and those biding on the Black-Red mountain, along
with those topmost speeded fly-jumpers living on Mt. Great-Ochre swilling palm-toddy, these are to
be summoned. Further, the vanara-s who will be in the tinge of rising sun and who dwell in the
highly delightful, richly fragrant and lofty woodlands that are surrounded with the delightful
hermitages of sages are to be summoned. Along with them, the vanara-s who are in the interiors of
forests, they are also to be called for. Why citing a few? Those and those monkeys that are on the
earth, all of them are to be assembled. Oh, Hanuma, you quickly summon all of the topmost speeded
vanara-s by employing concessions, conciliations and the like procedures. [4-37-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9]

"In the first instance highly speedy vanara-s are hastened at my commanded, however,
you hasten some more monkey chiefs for the purpose of hastening them. [4-37-10]

"Those that are entangled with creature comforts, and those that are stringy
dawdlers, you quickly lead all of those monkey chiefs in here. [4-37-11]

"And such of those vanara-s that do not arrive within ten days by my command, those
miscreants are eliminable as the abusers of king's decree. [4-37-12]

"Let all the lionly monkeys available on earth that abide by my control start coming
to this place in hundreds, thousands, even in millions, by my command. [4-37-13]

"The champions of monkeys with ghastly aspects and similar in shine with the
mountains and clouds shall start coming here by my command, fly-jumping as though to overcast the
sky. [4-37-4]

"Let those vanara-s who know the routes to the dwelling places of other monkeys
expeditiously proceed on quick-routes, and gather all of the monkeys available on earth at my
command." Sugreeva ordered Hanuma that way. [4-37-15]

On hearing the order of Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, Hanuma, the son of Air-god
has started to dispatch valorous monkeys in all directions. [4-37-16]

In a split-second, the vanara-s that are sent by the king of vanara-s have
skyrocketed to the airways of birds and stars on their way, and indeed reached the vault of heaven,
which was once trodden by Vishnu. [4-37-17]

After skyrocketing those monkeys have reached the monkeys that are living at
seashores and islands, in the caves and crags of mountains, and at lakeshores and their surrounds,
and motivated all of the monkeys available there towards the cause of Rama. [4-37-18]

On hearing that command of the king of kings of Vanara-s, Sugreeva, who is semblable
with the Death-god and Time-god, all of the monkeys have arrived with the terror of Sugreeva
haunting them. [4-37-19]

Then thirty million fly-jumpers whose swiftness is inconceivable, and whose shine is
like that of black-mascara have sallied forth from mountain Anjana to there where Raghava is
camping, i.e., Mt. Prasravana. [4-37-20]

Hundred million monkeys who take delight on the best mountain where the sun goes
into dusk, namely the westerly mountains, <font color="#B3003A">asta adri</font>, and whose hue is
similar to the refined gold, for dusk has a golden hue, have jumped in. [4-37-21]

Vanara-s who are in the hue of lion's mane have turned up in thousand crores, say
hundred billion, from the pinnacles of Mt. Kailash. [4-37-22]

Those that are sheltered on Himalayas subsisting on fruits and tubers have arrived
in a thousand of thousand crores, say a trillion. [4-37-23]

Millions and millions of Vanara-s whose looks and deeds are gruesome, and who equal
the planet Mars in their crimson-flush, as they dwell on the hotbeds of Mt. Vindhya, have swiftly
alighted from Mt. Vindhya. [4-37-24]

The count of those vanara-s who are basically domiciled at the coasts of milky
ocean, the residents of Tamala woodlands, and those who feed on coconuts dwelling in coconut
groves, and who have presently come from those places is uncountable. [4-37-25]

That highly forceful military force of vanara-s has arrived from forests, caverns
and riversides with their leaping and bounding on the sky blocking up the sun as if they have
gulped him down. [4-37-26]

The Vanara-s who went from Kishkindha to hasten up all the other monkeys of all
quarters, those champions have reached Himalayan Mountains and saw exceptional trees on them.
[4-37-27]

On that best and auspicious mountain, once a glorious Vedic-ritual intending God
Shiva took place, which pleased the hearts of all gods. [4-37-28]

There the vanara-s have seen luscious tubers and fruits similar to nectar, which
have originated from the oblational food material spattered in the Vedic-ritual for Shiva.
[4-37-29]

If one eats for one time, a little of those divine and heart-pleasing fruits and
tubers that have taken their origin from that oblational food material, he remains satiated for a
month. [4-37-30]

The best monkeys that are fruit-eaters have collected those divine fruits, tubers,
and even the divine medicinal herbs. [4-37-31]

On going to the cardinal ground of Vedic-ritual which was performed once, those
vanara-s fetched highly fragrant flowers in order to please Sugreeva. [4-37-32]

On motivating all of the monkeys on earth, all those best monkeys who proceeded to
forgather other monkeys, quickly returned to Kishkindha ahead of the forgathered troops of monkeys.
[4-37-33]

Those quick paced monkeys quickly reached Kishkindha just at that moment when
Lakshmana is still with Sugreeva, and those monkeys arrived at that place where Sugreeva is
available along with Lakshmana. [4-37-34]

Taking the medicinal herbs, fruits, and tubers along with them, all of those
Vaanaras obliged Sugreeva to accept fruits, tubers and herbs as royal gifts, and they also spoke
this word to Sugreeva. [4-37-35]

"We have rounded up all the mountains, rivers, and forests even, and all of the
Vanara-s available on earth are fetched to your fore according to your command." Thus the monkeys
said to Sugreeva. [4-37-36]

On listening these words then the king of fly-jumpers Sugreeva is gladdened and
accepted the gifts brought from Himalayas from all of them. [4-37-37]

Then that Hanuma, who has good deeds for his credit, on hearing the words of
Lakshmana, and even knowing that they are finely meaningful, he rejoicingly recalled in his mind
that Sugreeva's effort is going to fructify. [4-4-1]

"Conceivable is the retrieval of the kingdom by that great souled Sugreeva...and for
which deed, this purposive Rama has come, and that deed desired by Rama is also achievable by
Sugreeva, and thus all this has came by..." thus thought Hanuma. [4-4-2]

Then Hanuma, the ablest flyer is thus very gladdened...and in turn then spoke to
that very learned one, namely Rama. [4- 4-3]

"What for you have come into these perilous forests hemming in Pampa Lake along with
your brother, for these are impenetrable forests abounding with many a serpent and animal?" Thus
Hanuma asked Rama. [4-4-4]

On hearing the words of Hanuma, Lakshmana motivated by Rama, narrated about the
great soul Rama, the son of Dasharatha. [4-4-5]

"The king named Dasharatha, a resplendent one and the patron of virtue was ruling
the four-caste system with its, and by his own rectitude, for he is also bound within that
four-caste system... [4-4-6]

There is none despising him, nor he despised any and for all the living beings he is
like the Grandparent Brahma on earth... [4-4-7]

"And he, King Dasharatha who performed rituals agniSToma and the like Vedic rituals
wherein he donated liberally, and this one is his eldest son, and he is renowned among people by
the name of Rama... [4-4-8]

"He is the protector of all beings and the follower of father's directives, he is
the eldest one among the sons of King Dasharatha... possessor of high virtues, qualities and royal
fortune befitting to a king... but he is deprived of his kingdom, and came hither to dwell in the
forests... nevertheless, followed by me...[4-4-9, 10]

"With his wife Seetha following him, oh, highly fortunate Hanuma, this
self-controlled and highly resplendent Rama came to forests like the Sun followed by his consort
Prabha, who vanishes when the day is abated...

With his wife Seetha following him, oh, highly fortunate Hanuma, this
self-controlled and highly resplendent Rama came to forests like sun with his dwindling
resplendence when the day is abated... [4-4-11]

"I am the one who obtained servitude by the justness of this faithful and
knowledgeable one, and his younger brother, by name I am named as Lakshmana... [4-4-12]

"He who aspires to keep up the well-being of all the beings, and he who is merited
for all comforts and respectability is now devoid of his prosperity and predisposed to forest
dwelling... such as he is, his wife is abducted by a guise changing demon in a lonely place, of
whom we know not... we know not which demon stole his wife... [4-4-13, 14]

"One named Danu, son of Diti, who acquired demon-hood by curse had said that
Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys, is a capable one, and he even said, "that great valorous Sugreeva
can know about the abductor of your wife..." saying thus that Danu is released from the curse of
his demon-hood, moved skyward and went away to heavens while becoming self-luminous... [4-4-15,
16]

"All this is informed to you, as it is as you have asked..Myself and Rama, we now
have our recourse to Sugreeva alone... [4-4-17]

"He who gave away riches in charity, who obtained unequalled renown and who himself
was the lord of this world earlier, now accepts the lordship of Sugreeva... [4-4-18]

"Who was a patron of virtue and who himself was a shelterer, to whom Seetha is the
daughter-in-law, such a shelterer's son Rama is now taking shelter under Sugreeva... [4-4-19]

"He who is a virtuous one and protector of all the world, and who is the only refuge
for all in earlier times... such a Raaghava, my mentor, is now seeking refuge with Sugreeva...
[4-4-20]

"By whose beneficence all these people are always delighted, he that Rama is now
seeking benefaction from the lord of monkeys... [4-4-21]

"By which kingDasharatha, are all the kings with all possible good attributes are
always, and at all the times were esteemed to be safeguarded as defensible kings, such king's
eldest son Rama, renowned in all the three worlds for his own sheltering the needy, has now taken
shelter under monkeys lord Sugreeva... [4-4-22, 23]

"One who is rebuffed by sadness, and even agonised by it had already sought refuge,
hence it is apt of Sugreeva to do favour in Rama's respect along with other vanara commanders..."
Lakshmana said thus to Hanuma. [4-4-24]

To Lakshmana, who is telling that piteously with tears falling out, the eminently
lettered Hanumaan said this in his return. [4-4-25]

"Intellectuals of your kind, who have conquered anger and senses are to be seen by
the chief of monkeys Sugreeva, for your advent is godsend... [4-4-26]

"He who is made as an enemy, very muchinsulted, and abrogated from kingdom by his
own brother Vali, that Sugreeva is roaming about forests fearing him alone, his own brother Vali...
[4-4-27]

"He that son of Sun, Sugreeva, will render help to you two, joining forces of our
like Vanara-s in searching Seetha..." [4-4-28]

Thus Hanuman on speaking melodious words with politeness, also said to Raghava as,
"good, we may now approach Sugreeva...." [4-4-29]

Hanuma when said thus virtuous Lakshmana adored him customarily in the way befitting
to an envoy, and spoke this to Rama... [4-4-30]

"Raghava, as to how this monkey seems to be happy in meeting us, by way of his
narration, and he too neared us as an aspirant of some deed to be performed by us, hence joining
them seems to fulfil your mission... [4-4-31]

"He is talking with a lucid expression and pleasing facial tinge by which he seems
to be gladdened at his heart... needless is telling untruths to such a valiant son of Air-god,
Hanuma, isn't it!" So said Laskhmana to Rama [4-4-32]

Then he that very intelligent son of Air-god Hanuma, took those two valorous
Raghava-s to go to the king of monkeys Sugreeva. [4-4-33]

On discarding the ascetic's semblance that estimable monkey Hanuma obtained his own
monkey's form, and mounting those two valiant ones onto his back he proceeded towards Sugreeva.
[4-4-34]

Hanuma, the extensively renowned heroic son of Air-god with pious mind and highly
audacious nature, is then gladdened like the one whose difficult deed is just accomplished, thus he
gladly travelled to that mountain where Sugreeva is abiding, along with Rama and Lakshmana.
[4-4-35]

Then on hearing the words of Angada those best vanara-s, anamely Gaja, Gavaaksha,
Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, Mainda and Dvivida, and Susheshana, and like that Jambavanta have
individually said about their abilities in the matter of leaping the ocean according to their turn.
[4-65-1]

In that matter Gaja said, "I can fly ten yojana-s..." and Gavaaksha said, "I can go
over twenty yojana-s..." [4-65-3]

In that matter the vanara Sharabha said to the monkeys, "oh, fly-jumpers, I can
indeed go up to thirty yojana-s..." The vanara Sharabha said, "I can go up to forty yojana-s,
undoubtedly..." The great-resplendent Gandhamaadana said, "I can go up to fifty yojana-s, no
doubt..." The vanara Mainda said the monkeys in that matter, "I venture to jump just sixty
yojana-s..." Then the great-resplendent Dvivida informed, "I can go up to seventy yojana-s, no
doubt..." But mighty Shushena, the best and the great resplendent monkey said, "I promise to jump
eighty yojana-s..." [4-65-4]

Jambavanta, the oldest one among all of them, appreciating them who are telling
about their jumping capacities, has informed them in this way. [4-65-10]

"Previously there was some traversal daredevilry even for us, such as we were, we
are presently on the other shore of our age... [4-65-11]

"That being so, for which purpose the king of monkeys Sugreeva and even Rama are
decisively decided on this task, it is impossible for us to marginalize this task... [4-65-12]

"While we say you may hear what cruise we have at this age... we can go up to ninety
yojana-s, undoubtedly... [4-65-13]

Jambavanta further said this to all of those best monkeys, "my capability in the
stint of going was not definitely limited only thereunto... [4-65-14]

"Once I have performed circumambulation around the Omnipresent and Eternal Vishnu in
His incarnation as Trivikrama, when He grandiosely increased His physique from that of a
Divine-Dwarfish Brahman boy to that of an Omnidirectional Being, thus filling whole of the Universe
to tread all the three worlds, during the time of Vedic-ritual of Emperor Bali, the legatee of
Vairocana... [4-65-15]

"Such as I was, I am presently old and decrepit and I have become slow jumping
soldier of misfortune, though my energy in youth was unmatchable and unsurpassable. [4-65-16]

"Now, at this age it is possible for me to go on my own only thereunto... and by
that much endeavour that task will be unaccomplished..." So said Jambavanta to monkeys.
[4-65-17]

Then on reverencing the great monkey Jambavanta, the highly intelligent Angada
thereafter said these salutary words. [4-65-18]

"I can vault over this ocean which is broadwise in a hundred yojana-breadth, but
whether I am capable of coming back or not, it is indefinite... [4-65-19]

That expert in sentence making, Jambavanta said to the best one among monkeys namely
Angada, "oh, Angada, the best one among monkeys and bears, I know about your capability in
traversal... [4-65-20]

"Why a hundred, if need be you are capable to go up to a hundred thousand yojana-s
and come back... but this method of our sending you is uncanonical... [4-65-21]

"Oh, dear Angada, in anyway lord assigner cannot be an assignee, hence oh, best
fly-jumper, all of these people are assignable by you... [4-65-22]

"You are notionally established as our lord and we have to become your
protectionists and, oh, enemy-inflamer Angada, lord becomes the protectionist of army... this alone
is the method... [4-65-23]

"Oh, enemy-subjugator, really you are the linchpin to this mission, thereby oh, dear
Angada, you are always to be protected like anything that needs safeguarding... [4-65-24]

" 'The prime mover of a task is to be safeguarded...' is the byword of the
taskmasters, and indeed if only the prime mover is there, all the endowments are achievable that
yield fruits... [4-65-25]

"Thereby, oh, truth-valiant Angada, you are instrumental to this task and as you are
privileged with sagacity and audacity, oh, enemy-inflamer, you are the keystone for this task of
searching Seetha... [4-65-26]

"For us you are indeed a respectable one by yourself, and as the son of respected
Vali too, and oh, best monkey, sheltered by you we are indeed capable of achieving the objective of
our task..." So said Jambavanta to Angada. [4-65-27]

When that highly scholarly Jambavanta has said thus, the great monkey and the son of
Vali Angada said this sentence in reply as an answer. [4-65-28]

"If I am not proceeding to Lanka, nor any other monkey is proceeding, then we have
to undertake self-immolation once again, isn't it! [4-65-29]

"I do not perceive any secure protection for our lives on our going to Kishkindha
without fulfilling the bidding of that resolute king of monkeys Sugreeva... [4-65-30]

"Sugreeva is a lord who shows either forgiveness or furiousness immoderately... and
our going to Kishkindha trespassing his bidding is as good as our entering into our own doom...
[4-65-31]

"It will happen in that way only as our going back to Kishkindha results in no other
way, thereby it will be apt of you to think deeply, as you can envision the implications..." Thus
Angada said to Jambavanta. [4-65-32]

When that best and valiant fly-jumper Jambavanta is said that way by Angada, then
Jambavanta advised him in this best sentence to Angada. [4-65-33]

"Oh, brave Angada, this mission of yours will not be thwarted in the least. I will
motivate him who achieves success of this mission of searching Seetha... [4-65-34]

Then Jambavanta, the outstanding one among monkeys started to motivate the
exceptional fly-jumper, and a marvellous one among all the monkeys, and who by now is comfortably
sitting abiding a lonely place, namely Hanuma. [4-65-35]

Then Sugreeva who is gladdened again spoke to Rama of Raghu's dynasty, "My best
minister and this servant of yours Hanuma informed me of the reason for which you have come to
uninhabited forests along with your brother Lakshmana, and that while living in the forest, and
when you and this courageous Lakshmana are not her alongside a demon stole your wife Maithili, the
daughter of Janaka, wailing as she was. [4-6-3]

"And he also said about that arch demon's killing an eagle named Jatayu on waiting
for an opportunity, and his causing an agony in you by way of separating your wife. [4-6-4]

"Before long you will get rid off your agony caused by the separation of wife, for I
will fetch her very soon, like the retrieval Vedic Scriptures. [4-6-5]

"Oh! Enemy destroyer, Rama, I will fetch your wife to give her to you whether she is
in netherworlds or even in empyrean worlds. [4-6-6]

"You may know that this word of mine is definite oh, Raghava. Your wife is as good
as an indigestible foodstuff made with poison, indigestive even to Indra, put together with all
gods and demons. [4-6-7, 8a]

"Give-up your lamentation, oh, great-shouldered one, for I will bring back that lady
for you. And by inference I know her... undoubtedly I have seen Maithilee while that demon with
cruel deeds was abducting her... then she was crying piteously calling 'Rama, Rama...' and also
calling 'Lakshmana...' and she was writhing in the flanks of Ravana like the wife of serpent's
lord... [4-6-8b, 9, 10]

"Myself being the fifth one on the cliff of the mountain, on seeing me she dropped
the upper cloth of her sari along with auspicious jewellery. [4-6-11]

"We took those jewellery items and stored them, Raaghava... I will get them and it
will be apt of you to identify them..." thus said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-6-12]

Then Rama said to that pleasant talker Sugreeva, "Get them quickly, my friend, what
for you are delaying." [4-6-13]

Thus said Sugreeva then entered the cavernous cave of that mountain quickly, to
fulfil the yearning of Raghava. [4-6-14]

On taking and bringing the parcel of that upper cloth with the auspicious jewellery,
"This, you see..." saying thus that monkey started to show them to Rama. [4-6-15]

Then on taking that cloth and also the auspicious jewellery, Rama became like mist
filled moon with overfilling tears. [4-6-16]

But he who is blemished by tears that outpoured in all his friendship with Seetha,
leaving off his courage fell on the ground wailing, 'oh, dear... oh, dear...' [4-6-17]

The more he hugged those best decorative ornaments close to his heart, the more he
hissed like a wrathful serpent in a snake pit. [4-6-18]

With the unending rush of tears he saw Lakshmana at his side and started to wail
piteously. [4-6-19]

"Lakshmana, see this upper cloth and these ornaments too of Vaidehi, shed from her
body and dropped onto the ground while she is being abducted. [4-6-20]

"Seetha must have definitely dropped these ornaments onto pastureland, for they
appear to be in their original shape, indeed." So said Rama to Lakshmana. [4-6-21]

When Rama thus said Lakshmana said this, "I know not the bracelets and I know not
the earrings But because I always salute her feet I know these anklets well...[4-6-22]

" Then Rama sadly asked to Sugreeva, "tell me Sugreeva, towards which country that
ferocious looking demon abducted my dear one dearest than my lives, as spotted by you...
[4-6-23]

"For the sake of which demon I wish to eliminate whole of the demons, that
troublemaker of mine, where does he live, either... [4-6-25]

"By whom Maithili is abducted and thus caused indignation in me, he has opened up
the doors of his death suicidally. [4-6-26]

" Oh, king of the fly-jumpers, tell me which demon forcibly stole her, my dearest
one than all, by molesting her in the forest, tell me about that enemy of mine, for sure I will
lead him to the fore of Death today itself... [4-6-27]

"Then desiring both of our well-being I have begged of my brother who is enveloped
in anger and behaving capriciously. [4-10-1]

"Oh, orphan's, delight Rama, I addressed him like this, "Luckily you have eliminated
the enemy and returned safely, and to an orphaned one like me you alone are the protector.
[4-10-2]

Let this regal umbrella unfolded like a full moon, with its many of its spikes, and
with accompanying fur-fans may please be accepted while I hold it for you. [4-10-3]

"Saddened I was after staying at the entrance of the cave for one year, oh, king,
and on seeing the blood that started to flow from out the cave in the entrance my heart is engulfed
in sadness and my senses perturbed very much, and then covering that cave's entrance with a
hilltop, and departing from that country, I re-entered Kishkindha. [4-10-4, 5, 6a]

"On seeing me returning with grief, the citizens and ministers alike crowned me, but
that is not at my desire, therefore it is apt of you pardon me. [4-10-6b, 7a]

"As an estimable one you alone are the king, and I will be as I was, and
establishing me in kingship is owing to your unavailability, but the capital with citizens and
ministers is kept up without thorniness. [4-10-7b, 8]

"Oh, gentle one, I am now returning this custodial kingdom to you, oh, enemy
eliminator, you need not be hostile towards me. [4-10-9]

"I beg you with my bowed head and with my prayerful palm-fold, the ministers and the
city dwellers have collectively and forcibly nominated me to the kingship, only to keep the
kingless kingdom under control. [4-10-10, 11a]

"While I was speaking that politely he threatened me and indeed used many expletives
starting from 'fie, fie, upon you.' and the like. [4-10-11b, 12a]

"And summoning people and venerable ministers he hurled very abusive words at me
among friends. [4-10-12b, 13a]

"You all are aware that earlier the gigantic and rancorous demon Maayaavi invited me
desiring a duel in that night. [4-10-13b, 14a]

"On hearing his call for a duel I went out of the royal palace, and this very
hazardous brother of mine quickly followed me. [4-10-14b, 15a]

"And that formidable demon Maayaavi ran away as he was fraught with fear on seeing
me with a second one at my side, and he speedily entered a great cavity of earth on seeing us two
nearly reaching him. [4-10-15b, 16]

"On knowing the demon's entry into that great precarious cavity, I said to this one,
this cruel looking brother of mine. [4-10-17]

"My power will not let me return from here to the capital without killing that
demon, hence you wait at this cavity's entrance, till I kill that demon and come out of the cavity.
[4-10-18]

"Believing that he stayed at the entrance of the cavity I entered that impenetrable
cavity, and then in searching for that demon there one year elapsed. [4-10-19]

"I have seen that terrified enemy of mine effortlessly, and I killed him immediately
along with all of his relatives. [4-10-20]

"That cavity has become impassable, since it is fully filled with the gushes of
blood emanating from the mouth of that demon who fell yelling onto ground. [4-10-21]

"On my killing that invading enemy easily, I could not see any exit from that cavity
as its mouth was closed. [4-10-22]

"Wherefore I did not get a reply though I repeatedly shouted, 'Sugreeva, oh,
Sugreeva.' thereby I was very saddened. [4-10-23]

"With my foot I pounded and smashed that lidded hilltop, and from there I exited
that way and arrived here. [4-10-24]

"As such this cruel fantasist of kingdom trammelled me in there forgetting the
clannishness." So said Vali to all the courtiers. [4-10-25]

"On saying thus that monkey ruthlessly banished me, then and there in the court
itself, who am with a single clothing on my body. [4-10-26]

"Thus he threw me away and even stole my wife, oh, Rama, and owing to his fear alone
I roamed all over the earth with its forests and oceans. [4-10-27]

"I who am saddened by stealing my wife have entered this safest mountain Rishyamuka,
which is impenetrable for Vali by another reason. [4-10-28]

"All this notable account of enmity is reported to you, oh, Raghava, and you may
examine the dire straits befallen on me at no fault of mine. [4-10-29]

"Oh, Rama, the fear-remover of all the worlds, it is apt of you to bestow me
invulnerability from the fear of Vali, and oh, valiant one, as well as to rein him in." Sugreeva
requested Rama thus. [4-10-30]

When he is requested thus by Sugreeva, that virtuous and resplendent Rama started to
tell Sugreeva, the words that abide by virtue, as though trivializing the task on hand.
[4-10-31]

"Admirable and sun-like burners are these arrows of mine that are now mingled with
my wrath, and they are bound fall on that evil minded Vali. [4-10-32]

"He that stealer of your wife, that evil-minded abuser of history lives as long as I
descry. [4-10-33]

"By my experience I see how you are deluged in a sea of sadness, but I will make you
to get over that sea, and you will definitely regain abundantly whatever you lost." Rama assured
Sugreeva thus. [4-10-34]

Hearing that sentence of Rama, which is enhancing happiness and self-esteem,
Sugreeva is very gladdened and further said this great sentence. [4-10-35]

Then they saw an inexorable ocean, the realm of Rain-god, tumultuous with out-roaring and implacable waves, and 
shoreless otherwhere. [4-53-1]

Which month is set as timeframe for the monkeys by king Sugreeva that month passed off while the monkeys are searching 
mountains, impassable areas and within the cavity concocted by the wizardry of demon Maya. [4-53-2]

Sitting on a foothill of Mt. Vindhya which is with fully flowered trees those virtue-souled monkeys are then driven 
in desperation. [4-53-3]

Then on seeing the treetops of spring season, weighty with flowers and enshrouded with hundreds of vines, they 
became incredulous with the fright of failing Sugreeva's timeframe. [4-53-4]

On discussing among themselves they found that spring season has arrived, and they also found the purpose of timely 
messaging about Seetha to Sugreeva is lost, thus they plumped down onto the surface of earth. [4-53-5]

The crown prince and a great foreseer Angada, the monkey, whose nape of neck is leonine and bullish, arms lengthy 
and sturdy, then as usual paying respects to elderly monkeys greeted all of the forest dwellers and spoke this 
sentence in a modest voice. [4-53-6, 7]

"Oh, monkeys, we all have started at the command of the king of monkeys, and the month fixed by him is zeroed 
out while we were in Black Cavity. Are you aware of it?" Thus Angada started to speak his mind. [4-53-8]

"We were sent out scheduling time calculating from the month of <font color="#B3003A">aashviiyuja</font> nearly 
October. Even that time fixed for us has also lapsed. Thereby, what is to be done next? [4-53-9]

"You all the pioneers in the pathway of principles, you have notched up the credibility of your king, you are 
all well-disposed in the well-being of your king, and you are the contrivers of any exploit. [4-53-10]

"All of you are unparalleled in all tasks, all your asperity is renowned in all directions, and all of you have 
come impelled by that ochreish eyed Sugreeva keeping me as your helmsman. [4-53-11]

"As of now our mission is incomplete hence we are scheduled to die, and there is no doubt about it. Who can be 
complacent by keeping the directive of monkey's king incomplete? [4-53-12]

"But in this matter of course, as the time set by Sugreeva is lapsed, it is appropriate for all of us forest dwelling 
monkeys to voluntarily undertake fasting unto death. [4-53-13]

"Instinctively Sugreeva is a tormentor and now he is institutionalised in lordship, thus he will not condone any 
of us as we will be as good as transgressors if we were to return. [4-53-14]

"Sugreeva commits sin alone in our respect by killing all of us as we failed in the facts about Seetha, therefore 
it is pertinent to enter upon fasting unto, leaving off our sons, wives, riches and houses and homes, too. [4-53-15, 
16a]

"That king Sugreeva definitely and freakishly tortures all of us on our going back futilely, hence suicide at 
this place is justifiable for all us. [4-53-16b, c]

"I am not anointed to crown-princedom by Sugreeva, but I am anointed by the unbigoted Rama, the king of people. 
[4-53-17b, 18a]

"That king Sugreeva who is already bound up in animosity with my father, and thus with me too, now on observing 
me transgressing his directive will decisively wish to liquidate me by a tyrannous victimisation. [4-53-18a, 19a]

"Of what use is the witnessing of my kith and kin at me when I am tortured in the prime of my life, hence here 
on this sacred seashore alone I will outwait my death fasting unto it." Thus Angada said to all the monkeys. [4-53-19b, 
c]

On hearing all that uttered by that youngish Angada, the crown prince, all of those prominent Vanara-s sympathetically 
spoke these words. [4-53-20]

"Instinctively Sugreeva is a hot-tempered vanara and Raghava is interested in his beloved wife. The timeframe 
is lapsed and Vaidehi is unspotted. If we go back to Kishkindha now, on seeing us returning without completing 
our assignment, and with a thinking to satisfy Rama Sugreeva wishes to liquidate us without any doubt. [4-53-21, 
22]

"It will be inexcusable for the culprits to pass at the sideways of lords, then where is the question of their 
coming into king's audience, and we should be barefaced to return because we are all the chieftains of Sugreeva 
who are coordinated and sent here. [4-53-23]

"If we do not return to that champion Sugreeva on searching somewhere here for Seetha, or on our educing some 
information about her, we will rather enter the realm of Yama, the Terminator." Thus the other monkeys discussed 
among themselves. [4-53-24]

On hearing the words of fly-jumpers, who are tormented by fear of Sugreeva, Lt. Tara spoke this to them, "enough 
is your desperation, if you all are interested let us enter that cave again where we can live. [4-53-25]

"That highly impassable cavity is contrived by the demon Maya and it is abundant with trees, water, eatables and 
potables, and there is no fear even from Indra in that cavity, nor from Raghava, nor from Sugreeva, the king of 
monkeys." So said Lt. Tara to all. [4-53-26]

On hearing Angada's words, as well as the words of Lt. Tara that are trended to Angada's words, all the monkeys 
compliantly spoke with believability, "in which way we all will not be killed that way may be waymarked, and promptly 
make it happen now only." So said all the monkeys to Angada. [4-53-27]

A word about this and next four chapters. These chapters from 59 to 63 do not find
place in various other mms, besides having some contradictory statements in their verses. Hence,
these are said to be interpolated chapters. However, if it is questioned as to why they are still
being incorporated in translations, in spite of the irregularities noticed, for this the reply is
'because most ancient commentators have given elaborate commentaries on them they are stetted...'
and thus these chapters are held valid.

On hearing the words of that kingly eagle Sampaati that are relishable like
ambrosia, then those best fly-jumpers are gladdened and rejoiced. [4-59-1]

Then the best fly-jumper Jambavanta got up along with all of the fly-jumpers from
the surface of earth on which they sat for self-immolation, and spoke to kingly eagle Sampaati.
[4-59-2]

"You please tell vividly as to where is Seetha, who has actually seen her, who has
abducted Maithili, and thus you help all these forest-dwellers. [4-59-3]

"Who is inadvertent of the onslaught of Rama's arrows, or of those that are
personally bolted by Lakshmana, which arrows will be falling with the speed of thunderbolts?" Thus,
Jambavanta and others asked Sampaati. [4-59-4]

Sampaati is gladdened at the monkeys who refrained from self-immolation, and he
gladly said this sentence to them so as to cheer them up who are now contemplating to listen about
Seetha. [4-59-5]

"I will now narrate as to how I have listened about the abduction of Vaidehi, by
whom it is said to me, and where that wide-eyed Seetha is... [4-59-6]

"At one time I fell down on this impassable mountain which is breadth-wise in many
yojana-s, whereupon my age has advanced and my liveliness and forcefulness have slackened...
[4-59-7]

"My son who is the best one among all birds, and who is named as Supaarshva by his
name is sustaining me who am deteriorated to dire straits, with timely sustenance... [4-59-8]

"Passion is exigent to the celestial-artists gandharva-s, aggression is exigent to
snakes, fear is exigent to deer, like that hunger is exigent to us, the eagles... [4-59-9]

"On some day when hunger was aching me and I was aching for food, my son Supaarshva
turned up without flesh when the sun of the day went down... [4-59-10]

"I reproved him as I was deprived of food, and my son who is an enhancer of my
gladness pacified me and said this sentence about what has actually happened ... [4-59-11]

" 'Oh, father, I as a desirer of flesh flew up to skies in time and overspreading
the Mt. Mahendra, I very well hovered on it... [4-59-12]

" 'I have been hovering there looking downward to completely impede the pathway of
thousands of underwater beings of the ocean on my own... [4-59-13]

" 'There I have seen someone who in simile is like a shoved heap of mascara and he
is going away captivating a lady who equals the aurora in her shine. [4-59-14]

" 'On seeing two of them I resolved to use them up for the purpose of food, but he
benignly, basely and beggarly besought way-leave for their traversal... [4-59-15]

" 'There will be none assaulting those that entreat in a beggarly manner, even
someone among basely people, isn't it! Then what else is to be said of my kind, aha! [4-59-16]

" 'He hastily went away as though enshrouding the skies with his vigour, and then
the beings that move in the firmament have approached and applauded me... [4-59-17]

" 'The great-sages who approached me in firmament have said to me, 'fortunately
Seetha is alive, somehow he that Ravana has gone away with Seetha who in fact is to be protected by
one and all like you, anyhow your are blest without a doubt... [4-59-18]

" 'Then those siddha-s, the celestial sages, have informed me on showing her whose
ornaments and ochry-silk-sari are disorderly, and who is vanquished by the speediness of her
anguish, and who is yelling both the names of Rama and Lakshmana, as the wife of Dasharatha's Rama,
the daughter of Janaka. They have also informed on showing him who is abducting her as Ravana, the
king of demons. [4-59-19, 20, 21a]

" 'And hence, oh, father, the lapse of time in my returning home...' thus that best
sentence maker Supaarshva informed me all the drift in its entirety..." Thus Sampaati is continuing
his narration to monkeys. [4-59- 21b, 22a]

"Even on listening that it has not come to my mind to dare Ravana. How a wingless
bird can initiate any action, indeed! [4-59-22b, 23a]

"But that which is possible for me to do is advising as a votary with the qualities
of thinking and advising. Let it be heard as I narrate and in that matter of translating my
information into action it certainly depends on your bravery. [4-59-23b, 24a]

"Indeed with my analysis and information to you I wish to make all of you exuberant
as I deem that I have done my bit, because whatever task of Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is there
that task is mine too. There is no doubt bout it. [4-59-24b, 25a]

"Thereby, I reckon you as the best ones by your aptitude, fortitude and attitude,
and as invincible ones even for gods, hence Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, shepherded you...
[4-59-25, 26a]

"What is more, the excruciating eagle-feathered arrows of Rama and Lakshmana are
enough to give defence or offence to all the three worlds. [4-59-26b, 27a]

"Perchance that Decahedral demon is definitely a powerful and prideful demon. But,
as capable vanara-s there is nothing impossible to you, even in the least. [4-59-27]

"Thereby, enough is the time-lapse and make a mental determination. Adventurers and
prudent souls of your kind with not backslide in tasks, isn't it! [4-59-28]

Mindful of the words of noble-souled Sugreeva, Hanuma took his flight from Mt. Rishyamuka to where Raghavaa-s 
are. [4-3-1]

Casting off his monkey's semblance Air-god's son Hanuma attained the persona of an ascetic, for that 
monkey is incredulous in mind about Raghava-s. [4-3-2]

Then on nearing Raghava-s that Hanuma voicing softly and well pleasingly like an obedient one, that 
best monkey befittingly hailed, greeted and praised those two valiant ones. [4-3-3, 4a]

The best Vanara Hanuma spoke soft-wordily, as desired by Sugreeva, to those candidly resolute ones, 
on making reverent obeisance to both of them. [4-3-4b, 5a]

"You two look like kingly saints, or deities by your build, ascetics with blest vows, but with ideal 
complexions... how come you arrived at this countryside scaring the herds of animals and other inhabitants 
of this forest... [4-3-5b, 6]

"You mighty ones you are watching the trees grown on the banks of Pampa from all over, and owing to 
your presence on these banks you make this river Pampa with its propitious waters to shine forth... 
but you with your golden hue appear as courageous ones, yet you sigh over repeatedly, you wear jute-cloths, 
yet you look mighty shouldered... who are you that distress all the beings in this forest... [4-3-7, 
8]

"Dauntless, bold and brave are you with sharp glances of lions, wielding bows like that of Indra's bow 
you are the real enemy destroyers... glorious, splendid, and even impetuous you appear like Sacred Bulls... 
elephant's trunks are your arms... and you foremost among men are self-resplendent... [4-3-9, 10]

"This lord-like mountain is effulgent with your effulgence, you two look as kingdom-worthy, or worthy 
divinities, but how you have reached this countryside now... [4-3-11]

"Eyes of yours are like fine lotus petals, are you superhuman... nay, you wear tufts and braids, are 
you some undaunted human ascetics... nay, you look clonal, are you from some world of gods... nay, you 
are on earth, does this earth have a chance to receive Sun and Moon on her by her fortune... nay, are 
you some broad-chested deities in human form... lion-shouldered, very vehement and vigorous like Sacred 
Bulls... who you might be... [4-3-12, 13, 14a]

"Also lengthy are your hands, and spherical are your shoulders similar to clubs... they are worthy for 
decoration with every kind of ornament, for what reason they are undecorated... [4-3-14b, 15a]

"I deem that each of you are the choicest one to protect the earth adorned with Mt Meru and Vindhya 
range, and with all her oceans and forests... [4-3-15b, 16a]

"And these awesome bows are polished with odd things are smooth, and they are brightening like the gilded 
Thunderbolt of Indra. [4-3-16]

"Full with hazardous, life terminating, fiery snake like sharp arrows are these quivers, admirable in 
their appearance... [4-3-17b, 18a]

"Dazzling are these amply wide, broad and gilded swords like the snakes just released from their moults... 
[4-3-18b, 19a]

"When I have been talking to you this way, what for you don't speak up... one named Sugreeva, somebody 
virtuous and worthily one among monkeys is expelled by his brother Vali, and he is roaming all over 
the world sorrowfully... [4-3-19b, 20]

"Delegated by that great soul and the king of important monkeys Sugreeva, I have come here and by name 
I am Hanuma, another Vanara... [4-3-21]

"He that righteous Sugreeva is desiring friendship with you two, and know me as a monkey and his minister, 
the son of Air-god... I had to come here from Mt. Rishyamuka in an ascetic's form only to appease that 
Sugreeva, and I can wend my way by my will, and wear any guise as I wish..." Hanuma said so to those 
brothers. [4-3-22, 23]

Saying thus to those valorous Rama and Lakshmana, Hanumaan, the sententious wordsmith, spoke nothing 
further. [4-3-24]

Hearing all those words said by Hanuma, that illustrious Rama is well pleased facially, spoke to his 
brother Lakshmana who is standing at his side. [4-3-25]

"He is the minister of that noteworthy soul and king of monkeys, Sugreeva... whom alone I cherish, but 
he himself has drew nigh of me, on his own... [4-3-26]

"Soumitri, with this minister of Sugreeva, the knower of sententiousness and a pleasant worded one, 
and one with friendliness you exchange pleasantries with that enemy destroyer Hanuma... [4-3-27]

"Nay...the non-knower of Rig Veda, or the non-rememberer of Yajur Veda, or the non-scholar of Saama 
Veda... can possibly, or truly speak this way... [4-3-28]

"Definitely grammar is severally and comprehensively learnt by him... and though much is said by him 
not a single word has gone amiss of verbiage... [4-3-29]

"On his face or eyes, or on forehead or brows, or on other faculties of expression no fault is found...even 
at the least... [4-3-30]

"Unexpanded, un-doubtful, un-delaying and non-dissonant is the tenor of his speech, and it comports 
in his chest or throat in a medium tone...[4-3-31]

"He has orderly refinement in speech that is remarkable and un-delaying, and he speaks propitious words 
that are heart-pleasing...[4-3-32]

"His speech is generated in three places is enthralling... and whose heart is it that is disenchanted, 
even that of an enemy after raising his sword at him, on hearing his speech...[4-3-33]

"Oh, faultless Lakshmana, if this sort of envoy is not there to a king, really how can that king accomplishes 
his ways and means... [4-3-34]

"Should a king have this kind of work accomplishers with a variety of virtues, all his objectives will 
be achieved impelled by such an envoy's words..." Rama thus said to Lakshmana. [4-3-35]

When said thus by Rama, wise-worded Lakshmana spoke to that monkey and the minister of Sugreeva, namely 
Hanuma, the son of Air-god, who is equally a wise-worded one. [4-3-36]

"The virtues of that great soul Sugreeva are known to us, oh, scholarly monkey, we for our part are 
in search of that lord of fly-jumpers Sugreeva alone... [4-3-37]

"As you communicated the words of Sugreeva, oh, gentle Hanuma, by them and by your words we indeed wish 
to do accordingly... [4-3-38]

On observing that operative sentence of Lakshmana the monkey Hanuma is gladdened, as seen from his composure, 
and kept his mind at ease at the prospective victory, and then he wished to materialise the pact of 
friendship between Rama ad Sugreeva, at the earliest. [4-3-39]

Rama, the best proponent of probity, happily embraced Sugreeva with both of his arms and replied him who is speaking 
in this way suppliantly adjoining palms at Rama. [3-39-1]

"There is no wonder, oh, enemy-flamer, if Indra gives rain, or if that thousand-rayed sun makes the sky undark, 
or if the moon makes night shiny with his moonshine, so also oh, gentle one, if a true-friend of your kind gladdens 
his indigent-friend, there is no wonder. [3-39-2, 3]

"In this way, oh, nice Sugreeva, that helpful nature which is decorously prevailing in you, ushering you for organising 
the worthwhile, will not be a wonder but natural. I am aware that you have always been the exponent of affability. 
[3-39-4]

"With you as the helmsman, oh, friend, I will be triumphing over all the enemies, and you alone are worthy to 
proffer a helping hand to me as a good-hearted friend of mine. [3-39-5]

"That knavish demon Ravana deceitfully carried off Vaidehi for his own extinction, as demon Anuhlaada carried 
off Sachi Devi, the daughter of Puloma. [3-39-6]

"As soon as possible I wish to eliminate that Ravana with sharp arrows, as has been done by the enemy slyer Indra 
when he eliminated the insolent father of Sachi Devi, namely Puloma." Thus Rama is about to tell other things 
to Sugreeva, but... [3-39-7]

In the meanwhile dust started to overcast the sky covering the intensely scorching radiation of the sun. [3-39-8]

Stained with that darkness the directions are confounded, and the entire earth together with its mountains, woods, 
and forests has wobbled. [3-39-9]

In a split-second the entire ground is then enshrouded with incalculable fly-jumpers whose size is mountainous, 
fangs excruciating, and might abnormal, and each monkey commander is surrounded with hundreds of millions of legions 
of monkeys, who by their wish can change of their guise, and these monkeys of amazing strength have come crashing 
war-whoops as clouds letting out thunders while they are on their way from their habitation like riversides, seashores, 
mountains, and some other monkeys have come from forests as they are forest dwellers, and in the vast of masses 
their complexion alone remained as an identity to their habitation, like the stripe of tender-sun of some monkeys 
is marking them from the place of rising sun, moon-white body colour of some more telling that they are from the 
place of nightly moon, and the colour of skin looking like lotus-fibrils of many more indicates that they are 
from fertile watery lands, and the snow-white complexion of yet some more indicates that the dwelling place of 
those monkeys is Mt. Meru. [3-39-10, 11, 12, 13]

In the meantime the arrival of a distinguished and valorous vanara named Shatabali, hemmed in with ten thousand 
crores of vanara-s, came into the view of Rama and others. [3-39-14]

Sushena, the father of Lady Tara, a valorous one with the sheen of golden mountain then appeared with very many 
thousands of crores of vanara-s. [3-39-15]

Like that the most efficient vanara-chief Taara, the father of Ruma and Sugreeva's father-in-law, turned up with 
another thousand crores of vanara-s following him. [3-39-16]

Honourable Kesari, the father of Hanuma, with his bodily gleam like that of the fibrils of lotuses and visage 
glittering in the gleam of nascent sun, and who is an intellectual, graceful and prominent vanara among all the 
vanara-s, then came into view associated with thousands and thousands of armies of vanara-s. [3-39-17]

Gavaaksha, the formidably adventurous sovereign of baboons is then seen encircled by a thousand crore vanara-s. 
[3-39-19]

Dhuumra, the enemy destroyer, marched to the fore of Rama and others surrounded with two thousand crores of bears 
which have frightful fastness. [3-39-20]

The highly valorous commander named Panasa has then arrived attended by a three crore legion of horrendous vanara-s 
who are beaming forth like gigantic mountains. [3-39-21]

Commander Niila has then come into view with his colossal and blackish mascara mound-like body encircled by ten 
crores of vanara-s that are selfsame to their leader. [3-39-22]

Then the great-mighty commander named Gavaya whose bodily sheen is like that of a golden mountain has come forth 
surrounded by five crores of vanara-s. [3-39-23]

Dariimukha, the mighty commander then came along with a thousand crore vanara-s and he stayed nearby Sugreeva 
drawing nigh of him. [3-39-24]

Both Mainda and Dvivida, the great-mighty sons Ashvini-twin gods have then appeared, each with a thousand crore 
vanara-s. [3-39-25]

The mighty, braving and highly resplendent Gaja came forth to the near of Sugreeva encompassed by three crores 
of vanara-s. [3-39-26]

A great resplendent one who is renowned by his name Jambavanta has then come with a brigade of ten crore bears 
spreading around him and stood firm under the control of Sugreeva. [3-39-27]

A blaze-like mighty vanara named Rumana came swiftly surrounded with a hundred crore legion of vanara-s who are 
highly venturesome. [3-39-28]

Gandhamaadana has then arrived while ten thousand crores and hundred thousand crores of monkeys are following 
him at his behind. [3-39-29]

Angada, the crown prince of Kishkindha, who matches his father Vali in valour has then turned up with a thousand
<font color="#B3003A">padma</font> legions and a hundred <font color="#B3003A">shanku</font> legions of vanara-s. 
[3-39-30]

Tara, the vanara-commander, whose sparkle is as that of stars and whose valour is remarkable then appeared at 
a distance with five crore monkeys. [3-39-31]

Indrajaanu, the brave monkey commander who is the chief of eleven crores of monkeys has appeared then encompassed 
by selfsame vanara troopers. [3-39-32]

Rambha whose bodily glow is like that of tender-sun has then come forth fenced in a thousand plus a hundred of
<font color="#B3003A">aayuta</font>-s of vanara legions. [3-39-33]

A braving and powerful legion commander of vanara-s named Durmukha has then appeared encompassed with two crores 
of vanara-s. [3-39-34]

Then Hanuma appeared with a thousand crore vanara-s encompassing him who in shape are like the summits of Mt. 
Kailash and whose bravery is formidable. [3-39-35]

Highly vigorous Nala has also arrived while he is surrounded with a hundred crore one thousand and one hundred 
monkeys, the dwellers on trees. [3-39-36]

Dadhimukha, the salutary vanara-chief then arrived at the near of that great-souled Sugreeva encircled by a ten 
crore vanara-s who are all blaring highly. [3-39-37]

Sharabha, Kumuda, Vahni, also even Ramha, these and many other vanara-s have come who by their wish are the guise-changers. 
And many of those other commanders who have presented themselves along with their troops, overspreading the earth 
inclusive of its mountains and forests, their count is unknown. [3-39-38, 39]

All those fly-jumpers arrived by swinging, flying and thundering, and all of the monkeys on earth have arrived 
thus, presented themselves and settled down around Sugreeva as if a number of clouds are cramming the sun. [3-39-40]

While arriving those monkeys made many a hue and cry of war, and those outstanding monkeys who are armed with 
a pair of their own arms have informed the vanara king Sugreeva about their arrival by tilting up their heads 
as in roll-call or in headcount. [3-39-41]

As befitting to them the other vanara leaders have come together to meet Sugreeva, and on their meeting with Sugreeva 
then they stayed behind with their palms adjoined. [3-39-42]

Then Sugreeva, the knower of rectitude, promptly informed about all of those paramount monkeys to Rama as to who 
is who, and staying with folded palms he addressed the forgathered monkey chiefs. [3-39-43]

"Oh, chiefs of vanara-s, on procedurally camping your forces everywhere on mountains, at riversides, and in forests 
according their comfort, the knower of absolute force, Rama, expects to inspect them to infer the forcefulness 
of your forces. [3-39-44]

Sugreeva is gladdened and satisfied too by that sentence, and said this sentence to
Lakshmana's elder brother, Rama the valiant one. [4-8-1]

"When you wth all kinds of endowment and good virtues are my friend, doubtlessly I
am worthy to be blessed by all gods in everyway. [4-8-2]

"Oh, merited one, with your help it will be possible to achieve kingdom of gods, oh,
lord, then why tell about one's own kingdom... [4-8-3]

"He who has gained the one born in Raghava-s dynasty as friend, to which sacred fire
bore the witness, such a being like me is estimable among his relative, more so among his
kind-hearted friends... [4-8-4]

"Even though I am a matching friend to you, that you will know soon, it will be
inexpedient of myself to talk about my inherent capabilities. [4-8-5]

"Great souls of your kind, whose hearts are purified like yours, oh, amiable Rama,
their friendship and courage will generally be stable. [4-8-6]

"Gentle souls will be knowing that silver or gold, or even prosperous ornaments are
not to be apportioned among themselves as this is mine and that is yours. [4-8-7]

"May he be rich or poor, saddened or gladdened, flawless or flawed, a friend is the
ultimate recourse to any. [4-8-8]

"On observing the course of friendship and knowing which is true friendship, the
true friends do not hesitate to extend wealth, pleasure or even their own country for the sake of
friendship." Sugreeva thus extolled Rama and his friendship. [4-8-9]

"That is thus only," said Rama before Lakshmana, which Lakshmana is sagacious,
resplendent and who vies with Indra, about what is said by Sugreeva, which Sugreeva is by now
soft-natured in his looks, doffing off his jittery look. [4-8-10]

Then on seeing Rama standing there with greatly mighty Lakshmana, Sugreeva cast his
sight with his bolting eyes around that forest. [4-8-11]

He that lord of monkeys Sugreeva has then seen a well flowered sala tree not far off
from there, covered with some leaves and bedecked with honeybees. [4-8-12]

And Sugreeva broke off one branch of that sala tree that is with many leaves and a
well charming one, and spreading it out for Rama, he sat on it with Raghava. [4-8-13]

On seeing those two sitting on a branch then Hanuma also broke a branch of sala tree
for the modest Lakshmana and seated Lakshmana on it. [4-8-14]

Then to him, who by now is comfortably sitting on a flowery mat laid by the bestrewn
flowers of sala trees on that best mountain like a quiet ocean, to such Rama who by his very
presence delights hearts, that gladsome Sugreeva said this in friendship with his gentle and
gracious words that fluttered with happiness while he spoke. [4-8-15, 16]

"My brother calumniated me and stole my wife, with his fear and my anguish haunting
me I am moving about this best mountain Rishyamuka. [4-8-17]

"Affronted by my brother, oh, Raghava, I am made as his enemy, such as I am, I am
living on with a scared and dazed vitality far flung in fear. [4-8-18]

"I am agonized by the fear from Vali, oh, protector of all the worlds, you protect
me too for I am unprotected, and able are you to accord protection." Thus Sugreeva appealed to
Rama. [4-8-19]

Thus said by Sugreeva, the resplendent and virtuous Rama, the patron of
righteousness replied Sugreeva as though laughing off the task. [4-8-20]

"Helping is the fruit of friendship while harming is enemy's trait, hence I wish to
kill him today only, that abductor of your wife..." Rama continued thus. [4-8-21]

"These are my arrows winged from pinion of the hern, oh, highly fortunate Sugreeva,
these that are decorated in gold sparkle sharply like the Thunderbolts of Indra, and they are
begotten from the reed forest of Kartikeya, ends tied with eagles feathers for fins, smooth are
their nodes, sharp are their tips that pierce sharply, and these will be like enraged snakes.
[4-8-22, 23]

"You may see your malicious and intimidating brother, someone denotative by name
Vali, eradicated with these very arrows and splintered down like a mountain." Rama said so to
Sugreeva. [4-8-24]

On hearing Raghava's words, the lord of monkey-force Sugreeva attained much
happiness and said, 'good, good...' [4-8-25]

"Rama, I am confounded in sadness, and for those lamenting sadly you are the only
recourse, and because you have befriended me I am opening up my woes before you. [4-8-26]

"By extending a helping hand and befriending me while sacred fire bore witness, you
have indeed become my dearest friend on par with my life, and hence I take promise on truth to
broach. [4-8-27]

"By befriending you I am able to say clearly about my internal sorrow without any
hitches and hold-ups, which is always rending my heart..." So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-8-28]

Sugreeva said this much sentence with tears abusing his eyes and his voice is unable
talk aloud since it is equally abused by tears. [4-8-29]

Sugreeva courageously controlled the sudden haste of tears that came up hastily and
suddenly like a river in the presence of Rama. [4-8-30]

He that bright Sugreeva controlled those tears, and on wiping his fortunate eyes,
but sighing heavily he again started to speak this sentence to Raghava. [4-8-31]

"Earlier he that forceful Vali deposed me from my kingdom, oh Rama, and speaking
harsh words he even banished me. [4-8-32]

"My wife who is loftier than my lives is stolen by him, and those that are my
sympathisers they are also captivated and imprisoned by him. [4-8-33]

"He that very evil minded one tried many times to annihilate me, and Raghava, I
killed those combatants monkeys that are deployed by Vali to kill me. [4-8-34]

"With the same doubt I did not even near you when I saw you... in fear everything
will be fearsome, isn't it... [4-8-35]

"Though I am engulfed in tribulations I still bear my lives even today due to these
important monkeys like Hanuma and others, who are the only helping hands of mine. [4-8-36]

"These are the friendly monkeys guarding me all over, while I go they go along with
me, and if I were to stay they too will stay. [4-8-37]

"Rama, this is briefly my sad-story and why tell this very broadly to you as it
would be too tedious... my elder brother Vali is a renowned one for his intrepidity, and he that
Vali alone is my enemy. [4-8-38]

"His end ends my distress and my later life and quietude are subjected to his
destruction. [4-8-39]

"Grief stricken such as I am, I have submitted as to how my misery ends, whether one
is gladdened or saddened he has recourse only to his friend." So said Sugreeva to Rama.
[4-8-40]

Hearing all that is spoken by Sugreeva, Rama asked, "What for chanced the enmity? I
am interested to listen, in its reality...[4-8-41]

"On knowing the cause of your enmity, oh, monkey, and after a proper thought, and
deciding upon the strength and weakness of the cause of enmity, or of the enmity itself, I will do
the needful very easily. [4-8-42]

"On hearing that you are insulted my intense anger that can flutter my heartbeat is
intensifying like the intensifying speed of waters in rainy reason. [4-8-43]

"Be glad to say in belief, Sugreeva, before I take aim with my bow, and even before
I release the arrow, and even before silencing your enemy." Rama assured Sugreeva in this way.
[4-8-44]

Thus said by the great souled Rama, Sugreeva is very much rejoiced along with four
of vanara-s available in his attendance. [4-8-45]

Then with a pleased countenance Sugreeva started to tell Rama about the cause of the
enmity, it all it truthfulness. [4-8-46]

The eminent ministers of tree-branch animals then surrounded Sugreeva, who is very much seared in grief and who 
is still wearing damp cloths, as he just a while ago offered watery oblations to his deceased brother, stood accessible 
to him. [4-26-1]

On going towards the dexterous Rama, whose exploits are effortless, all of those monkeys tarried with their palms 
adjoined as with the sages tarrying in the presence of Brahma, the Forefather. [4-26-2]

Hanuma, the son of Air-god, whose sheen is like that of the golden mountain Meru, and whose visage is like that 
of the tender sun in its glint, then spoke this sentence reverently adjoining his palms. [4-26-3]

"Oh, lord Rama, this magnificent kingdom of deferential monkeys who are armed with the teeth, and whose might 
is a privileged one - since our might is not dependent on any weapons or other tactical warfare, except our own 
bodily strength - and oh, Kakutstha, that which belongs to his father and forefathers, and that which is otherwise 
impossible for him to regain, Sugreeva regained such a kingdom with your grace. [4-26-4, 5a]

"And if you empower, this Sugreeva will enter the propitious city Kishkindha along with a group good-hearted friends, 
and he will get anointed procedurally with various essences and herbal-extracts as its king, and thus he can revamp 
all the administration. [4-26-5b, 6]

"He would like to honour you in a remarkable way with garlands and precious gems, hence it will be apt of you 
to enter this delightful mountain cave, namely Kishkindha, and you may kindly consolidate the congenial affinity 
between the governor and the governed for the very high exhilaration of Vanara-s." Hanuma appealed Rama in this 
way. [4-26-7, 8a]

When Hanuma said so, Rama the destroyer of valiant foes, an intellectual and an enunciator replied Hanuma in this 
way. [4-26-8b, 9a]

"As a conformist to the directives of my father, oh, gentle Hanuma, I am not supposed to enter either a village 
or a city. [4-26-9b, 10a]

"As and when the best one among Vanara-s valorous Sugreeva enters the highly flourishing and statuesquely Kishkindha, 
he shall be enthroned in the kingdom, immediately and procedurally. [4-26-10b, 11a]

Replying Hanuma thus, that knower of the etiquette Rama, also spoke to Sugreeva, who is rich in politesse and 
an imposing one by his might and valour. [4-26-11b, 12a]

"You may even crown this brave Angada as crown prince, he is the eldest son of your elder brother, his bravery 
is kindred to that of his father, and thus this enthusiastic Angada will be a well-chosen designee for the crown-princeship. 
[4-26-12b, 13]

"The four month period specified for rainy season has commenced, oh gentle Sugreeva, and this is shravaNa, the 
first month of rainy season that brings many showers. [4-26-14]

"This is not a time for any striving, hence you enter the propitious city Kishkindha, oh, gentle Sugreeva, and 
I for my part will stay on this mountain along with Lakshmana. [4-26-15]

"This mountain cave is heart-pleasing by being spacious with worthwhile breeze, oh, gentle one, water is copious 
and red and blue lotuses are aplenty about this place. [4-26-16]

"On the advent of <em>kaartika</em> month, October, say post-rainy season, you shall do your best in the cause of Ravana's 
elimination, and this is our covenant, and hence oh, gentle Sugreeva, for now enter your mansion, be enthroned 
in kingdom as well, and exhilarate your friends." [4-26-17, 18a]

Thus when Rama countenanced that best vanara Sugreeva entered the charming city Kishkindha which is so far ruled 
by Vali. [4-26-18b, 19a]

When the sovereign of vanara-s Sugreeva has entered the city, very gladly thousands of vanara-s have also entered 
and fenced off that lord of fly-jumpers from all over. [4-26-19b, 20a]

All the inmates and ministers in Kishkindha then revered the lord of monkey throngs Sugreeva with their head-bent, 
and they have also prostrated before him with an assiduously polite attitude. [4-26-20b, 21a]

Raising the rank-and-file members from their prostration, and on exchanging a word or two with them, that valiant 
and highly mighty Sugreeva entered the beautiful palace-chambers of his brother. [4-26-21b, 22a]

When that prodigiously venturesome arch-vanara Sugreeva has entered the palace his cohorts anointed him as gods 
would anoint the Thousand-eyed Indra. [4-26-22b, 23a]

A white parasol highly ornate in gold, long-furred royal-fans with golden handles that are the enhancers of celebrity 
are brought for Sugreeva's anointment. Likewise, on taking all kinds of jewels, seeds, herbs, sprouts of trees 
that are still exuding milky latex, also flowers, and white royal-robes and white body-cream, lotuses bloomed 
on dry-land, best sandal paste, also various and numerous perfumes, Holy-yellow-rice, gold, seeds that are small 
and fragrant called priyangu, honey, ghee, curds, skin of tiger, tassels of fragrant flowers, and invaluable sandal 
shoes, unguents before oil bath, orpiment preparations one in yellow called gorochana, and the other in red called 
Manshila, there arrived sixteen best and cheerful damsels. [4-26-23b, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]

They the Vanara-s have then started to anoint that best Vanara Sugreeva according to the tradition, having appeased 
the eminent Brahmans with jewels, garments and delicacies. [4-26-29]

Authoritative scholars in Vedic-hymns then spreading the ritual grass around the Fire-altar which is with enkindled 
Ritual-fire oblated fire oblations into it duly sanctifying them with hymns. [4-26-30]

On a splendid, choicest and finely upholstered throne with golden legs that is kept atop a rostrum that is shining 
forth with various flower tassels, Sugreeva is procedurally inducted to sit facing east to the chanting of Vedic 
hymns. Then, Vanara-s like Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, Mainda, Dvividha, also thus Hanuma, 
Jambavanta have started pouring pure water on Sugreeva, which the best vanara-s have collected from the rivers 
flowing to east, as well as to west, from each of the sacred-declivity of rivers, from every ocean, and stored 
in golden flasks. Thus those have anointed Sugreeva with those pellucid and well-perfumed waters poured from golden 
vessels through the auspicious horns of bulls as revealed in scriptures and as great sages have defined, which 
anointment is like eight of Vasu-gods anointing the Thousand-eyed Indra. [4-26-31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]

Hundreds and thousands of the great-souled and prominent vanara-s that are there, all of them have cheerily raised 
high hullabaloos while Sugreeva is anointed. [4-26-37]

The best one among monkeys Sugreeva graciously embraced Angada and anointed his as crown prince in order to effectuate 
Rama's word. [4-26-38]

On the anointment of Angada those fly-jumpers that have sympathy for him have acclaimed Sugreeva saying, 'well 
done, well done.' [4-26-39]

While that kind of pompous anointment is taking place all are gladdened and that way they repeatedly extolled 
the great-souled Rama, and even Lakshmana too. [4-26-40]

That magnificent city Kishkindha situated in the cave of mountain which is already splendorous with flags of triumph 
and banners is further splendorous with blithe and burly monkeys overspreading it. [4-26-41]

The valiant Sugreeva who is by now the king of monkeys army, then apprised the great-souled Rama about his grand 
anointment, and thus he not only regained his wife Ruma but also secured the kingdom, like the chief of divinities 
Indra. [4-26-42]

When those monkeys whose lives are almost purged spoke to Sampaati with such dreary
words, that thunder-voiced eagle tearfully spoke to those vanara-s. [4-58-1]

"Oh, vanara-s, of whom it is enounced that mighty Ravana felled him in a combat,
that one is my younger brother named Jatayu... [4-58-2]

"Even though I hear that my brother is slain I have to resign myself from any
activity owing to my oldness and my winglessness, and presently I am indeed incapacitated to
retaliate my brother's enemy... [4-58-3]

"Once, when the elimination of demon Vritta was taking place at the hand of Indra,
we two eagle-brothers sportively desiring to surpass each other flew sunward, and we have gone very
near to the scorch-rayed sun... [4-58-4]

"Covering the skyway we have gone to firmament much speedily, then bechanced is
noontide and thus bechanced is the scorching of the noontime sun, and then Jataayu started to
founder... [4-58-5]

"On seeing him who is being thwarted by scorching sunrays, then I started to cover
my highly fretful brother with both of my wings in all my brotherliness... [4-58-6]

"And oh, vanara-chiefs, when sunrays have utterly burned my wings I fell down on
this Mt. Vindhya, and while living hereabouts constrainedly, I could pay no attention to my
brother's experiences or, at least his existence, or otherwise..." So lamented old Sampaati.
[4-58-7]

When Sampaati the brother of Jataayu spoke in that way, then the highly discerning
crown prince Angada replied him. [4-58-8]

"If you are the brother of Jataayu, if you have heard whatever I have said in praise
of Jataayu, and if you are aware of the whereabouts of Ravana... please tell it... [4-58-9]

"If you are aware of the location of that bigoted and knavish demon Ravana, please
inform us. Doesn't matter whether that location is nearby or far off as we can search far and
wide..." Thus Angada asked Sampaati. [4-58-10]

Then Sampaati, the high-spirited elder brother of Jataayu, spoke these words that
are self-befitting and that would highly gladden the monkeys. [4-58-11]

"I am an eagle with utterly burnt wings and vanished valiance, even then, I wish to
render a best service in the task of Rama, at least verbally... [4-58-12]

"I have seen the netherworlds of Rain-god viz., earth and its substrata like
<font color="#B3003A">atala. vitala, sutala, paataala</font> terrains... and I have even seen those
empyrean worlds that were triply trodden by Vishnu, and the intermediary regions of upper and lower
worlds where gods and demons combated ghastlily, and because I am that aged I have also seen the
unseeable Milky Ocean when it was churned for ambrosia... [4-58-13]

"It is I who am to render service in this task of Rama firstly, than you vanara-s,
as the common enemy of Rama and Jataayu is my first enemy, but I am decrepit as oldness has marred
my vigour and vitality... [4-58-14]

"I have seen a youngish lady while she is being stolen away by the black-hearted
demon Ravana. She richly in her mien, embellished with every befitting jewellery for a princess,
and that lady in fury was bewailing calling, 'Rama... Rama...' even calling 'Lakshmana...' and she
was throwing her ornaments down and her limbs were highly wriggly to set herself free from that
demon... [4-58-15, 16]

"In the flank of that blackish demon her best ochry silk-sari was dazzling like
sunshine atop a blackish mountain, or like lighting athwart a blackish ocean... [4-58-17]

"Thus, I deem her to be Seetha by her excessive laudation of Rama, and let the
location of that demon be heard from me while I say about it... [4-58-18]

"Literally, he is the son of Vishravasa and brother of Kubera, and he presides over
the city named Lanka and he is known as Ravana... [4-58-19]

"There is a lavish city in the oceanic island afar a hundred yojana-s all in all
from here, which Vishvakarma, the Divine-Architect, has built, and it is called Lanka.
[4-58-20]

"Its multi-storied buildings are built very symmetrically and they will be in golden
tinge with completely golden doors. The golden podia of verandas are amazing. That city is securely
enclosed in a gigantic rampart that will be dazzling in the colour of sun... [4-58-21, 22a]

"Therein that Lanka pitiable Vaidehi wearing ochry silk sari is lodged in the
palace-chambers of Ravana, highly sentineled and baulked by demonesses, and you can find king
Janaka's daughter Maithili in there... [4-58-22b, 23]

"Now, oh, fly-jumpers, first get to the other shore of the island in southern ocean,
which ocean spans in an overalled width of hundred yojana-s from this side of seashore, then
landing on the other seashore you can see Lanka secluded all around by ocean, and in such a
water-walled Lanka you can see Ravana... hence, hurry up, and promptly triumph over Lanka...
[4-58-24, 25]

"I foresee by my prognosis that your sighting Seetha is definite at that place, and
definite is your return from there. The first flight level of birds is that of the small Kulinga
birds, house sparrows, songbirds and the like subsisting on food-grains. The second flight level is
that of the birds that are the eaters of leftovers like crows and doves, or the eaters of
tree-fruits like parrots. The third flight level is that of the wading birds like Bhaasa, Kraunca,
Kurara birds and cranes, herons and the like. The fourth flight level is that of hawks and the
fifth is that of the vultures. [4-58-26, 27, 28a]

"And the sixth flight level is that of the swans which derive their valour, vigour,
handsomeness and youthfulness by their majestic birth. But the uppermost path is that of the sons
of Lady Vinata, namely the Divine Eagle Garuda, and Anuuru, the non-stopping charioteer of Sun.
Because we eagles have our lineal descent from the Divine Eagle, we can soar to the uppermost
flyable path and see keenly... [4-58-28b, 29]

"By which raw-flesh-eating demon this deplorable deed of abducting Seetha is done,
if that demon is retaliated by Rama and you all, my vendetta towards the very same demon, caused by
his animosity towards my brother Jataayu will also be fulfilled... [4-58-30]

"Staying here I am clearly seeing Ravana and like that Janaki... even for us eagles,
our sight and power will be excellent like that of Garuda, the Divine Eagle... [4-58-31]

"Thereby, oh, vanara-s, dietetically and congenitally we eagles can always see till
the end of hundred yojana-s, comprehensively... [4-58-32]

"The leg-fighters, namely cocks, are destined to have their livelihood just at the
base of their feet, but our livelihood is to be obtained from the farthest... alas... [4-58-33]

"Let some idea be searched to leap the salty ocean. For sure, you will return to
Kishkindha on your finding Vaidehi, and on your becoming productive of you objective...
[4-58-34]

"I wish you would shift me to the residence of Rain-god, namely the ocean, for
oblating water in respect of my great-souled brother Jataayu who departed to heaven..." Thus
Sampaati spoke to the monkeys. [4-58-35]

Then those vanara-s of utmost dynamism on taking wing-burnt-bird Sampaati to the
husband rivulets and rivers, namely the ocean, placed him on the shoreline. Again, the vanara-s
sincerely brought back that king of birds, Sampaati, after his offering oblations to Jataayu, and
lodged him as a returnee at his own place. On deriving indication form Sampaati regarding Seetha,
Ravana and Lanka, those returnless vanara-s returned to their search while their gladness returning
to them. [4-58-36, 37]

On overseeing the crestfallen monkey-soldiery, which is with many hundreds and
thousands of soldiers, then Jambavanta sad this way to Hanuma. [4-66-1]

"Oh, valiant one in the world of vanara-s, being an erudite scholar among all the
scriptural scholars, Hanuma, why do not you mumble something, why do you resort to a calmly
loneliness... [4-66-2]

"By your brilliance and brawn, oh, Hanuma, you match up to king of monkeys Sugreeva,
or even to Rama and Lakshmana, as well... [4-66-3]

"The son of Kashyapa Prajapati and Lady Vinata is the best bird among all the birds
who is superbly mighty and who is universally renowned as Garuda... [4-66-4]

"Iindeed, I have oftentimes seen that highly glorious, rapidly speedy, great mighty
bird Garuda, pecking up reptiles from ocean... [4-66-5]

"Whatever is the strength of his wings, that much is the strength of you arms, and
even by the yardsticks of his dash and dare, yours too, are unreprovable... [4-66-6]

"Oh, forthright monkey, you are the finest among all beings by the dint of your
force, faculty, flair, and fortitude... why then is your unreadiness in this task of leaping
ocean... [4-66-7]

"Punjikasthala yclept Anjana is the nicest apsara among all apsara-s and she is the
wife of Kesari, the monkey... [4-66-8]

"She who is distinguished for her unparalleled mien in the three worlds, oh, dear
boy Hanuma, had to take a rebirth on earth as a monkey who can change her form by her wish, owing
to a curse... [4-66-9]

"She who took birth as the daughter of great souled monkey chief Kunjara, on
assuming a human physique, putting on caparisons of amazing garlands, dressed in silken clothing,
and shining forth with rarity of her beauty and nubility, at one time ambled on the top of a
mountain like a streak of lightning athwart a black-cloud of rainy season. [4-66-10, 11]

"When she is strolling on the mountaintop Air-god has slowly lifted up that
broad-eyed lady's auspicious and ochry silk apparel with red rouches... [4-66-12]

"Then the Air-god beheld her well-twinned, thickset, roundish thighs, and even the
paired off plumpish breasts, and her beautiful face which is well proportioned in its build...
[4-66-13]

"Just on catching the sight of that gorgeous one, whose pelvic-girdle is fat and
ample and who is slender-waisted, and who by all her limbs is pristine, the Air-god is enamoured...
[4-66-14]

"He that Air-god who is ensorcelled by Love-god in all of his limbs, though he is
limbless and existing in thin air, embraced that immaculate lady with both of his far-flung arms,
as he lost his heart for her... [4-66-15]

"But she that conscientious lady perplexedly said this sentence in that matter of
invisible hugging, 'who wishes to despoil my vow of one-man-one-wife...' [4-66-16]

"On listening the words of Anjana the Air-god spoke this in reply, 'oh, high-hipped
one, I don't dishonour you, hence let there be no fear in your heart, for I am the all-permeating
Air-god... [4-66-17]

" 'By which reason I embraced you and impregnate myself within you, by that reason
you are impregnated in a supersensory manner, thereby you will beget a valiant son endowed with
intellect... [4-66-18]

" 'An admirably brave, and a bravely dazzling, and a dazzlingly forceful, and a
forcefully overpowering son will be there, also thus, he will be a coequal of mine in flying off
and jumping up...' Thus, the Air-god said to Anjana. [4-66-19]

"Oh, arcane monkey Hanuma, when Air-god said so to her, oh, ambidextrous one, your
mother is gratified, and then, oh, bullish fly-jumpers, your mother very well divined you in a
cave... [4-66-20]

"Thereafter, when you were a boy you have see the just risen sun in the vast of
forest, and deeming it to be a just ripen reddish fruit, and thinking it to be a best catch, you
hopped up and flew towards sun on the sky... [4-66-21]

"Even on your flying up three hundred yojana-s, oh, brave monkey, and even when
sun's radiation puffed and blown you down, you did not get into any anguish as were
indefatigable... [4-66-22]

"Oh, mighty monkey, even on seeing you who are coming near the vault of heaven,
Indra is captivated by anger and by his effulgence he catapulted his Thunderbolt at you...
[4-66-23]

"Then, your left cheekbone, zygomatic arch, is broken when you fell down on a
highest mountaintop, from thereupon your name-phrase is indeed averred as <font color="#B3003A">Hanumaan</font>... [4-66-24]

"Then on observing that you are mutilated, highly infuriated is that scent-wafter
Air-god and that tempestuous Air-god has not physically circulated throughout the triad of
worlds... [4-66-25]

"When the triad of worlds is being roiled with breathlessness, all the
administrative gods of universe are bewildered, and they started to supplicate the Air-god for his
grace... [4-66-26]

"Oh, chivalric warrior at war, while the Air-god is being supplicated, oh, dear boy,
Brahma gave you a boon decreeing your 'indestructibility by any missile...' [4-66-27]

"On scrutinising that you are unhurt even after hit by Thunderbolt, oh, ablest
Hanuma, the Thousand-eyed Indra kind-heartedly gave you a choicest boon saying that your death
occurs only by your own volition... [4-66-28, 29a]

"Such as you are, you are Kesari's son through his wife, oh, frightful pugilist, and
you are the lineal son of Air-god, and even by your gusting you are selfsame to Air-god, and even
by your flying also you are his selfsame to Air-god, in all respects... [4-66-29b, 30]

"Presently we are as good as dead, and among us presently you are the only one rife
with competence and valiance, you are the other Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, to us...
[4-66-31]

"During the period of Trivikrama incarnation I have circumambulated the earth
inclusive of its mountains, forests and thickets for twenty-one times, moving rightward around
it... [4-66-32]

"Like that, by the order of gods we ourselves have collected those herbal plants
with which ambrosia had to be churned from Milky Ocean, and in that way, then there used to be a
great energy for us... [4-66-33]

"Such as I am, I am now aged and my valiance is completely lessened... but at the
present time, you alone are endowed with all endowments among us... [4-66-34]

"Thereby oh, vanquisher Hanuma, you give a jump-start to leap the ocean. Indeed, you
alone are the best one among all fly-jumpers, and this entire vanara army is anxious to witness
your prowess... [4-66-35]

"Arise, oh, lion-like monkey, leap over this vast ocean, oh, Hanuma, your escape
velocity is indeed unalike that of all the other beings... [4-66-36]

"Oh, Hanuma, all these monkeys are dispirited. Why this indolence of yours? You
boldly triumph over the ocean as your speed is highest, supersonic, super-photic, super-cerebric is
your celerity. As with Vishnu who trod the triad of worlds in a trice, you too triumph over..."
Thus Jambavanta persuaded Hanuma to get ready for action. [4-66-37]

Thereafter, when the best monkey among monkeys, namely Jambavanta, the king of bears
has motivated, then that son of Air-god, Hanuma, whose speed is familiar coupled with his
irresistible enterprise, enormously increased his physique as though to gladded the army of
monkeys. [4-66-38]

When Rama of undeterred stamina has become pitiable while yearning for Seetha,
overcome with grief while the search for Seetha is becoming futile, overwrought with anger while
Sugreeva is reneging on his promise, to such an elder prince-brother from a godlike king, his
younger prince-brother Lakshmana spoke in this way. [4-31-1]

"As a forester Sugreeva will not abide by the conduct of gentlefolk, he is not
appreciative of the fruits of incidental events like gaining kingdom and regaining wife occurring
out of your deed of eliminating Vali, thus he will not enjoy the prosperity of the kingdom anymore.
Obviously his prudence is behindhand, isn't it! [4-31-2]

"Without any notion of requiting the beneficence you have accorded he is insanely
involved in primitive pleasures, such as he is, let him see his elder brother Vali when slain.
Hence, kingdoms are unaffordable to dishonest. [4-31-3]

"Unbearable is this anger that is tiding quickly, now I shall kill that unfaithful
Sugreeva and the best braving monkeys shall search for that princess Seetha, remaining under the
command of Vali's son, Angada." Thus said Lakshmana to Rama. [4-31-4]

Rama, the slayer of braving enemies, spoke this well thought sentence that includes
persuasiveness to Lakshmana who is with an irrepressible wartime anger, who has apprised his
intention to slay Sugreeva, and who on taking his bow is now leaping at Kishkindha. [4-31-5]

"Certainly none of your kind shall commit this sort of sin in this world, and if
such a situation occurs, he who by his noble gesture kills his own anger is a valorous one, and he
really becomes the best one among men." Thus Rama is saying to Lakshmana. [4-31-6]

"Lakshmana, as person with righteous conduct you are not supposed to understand this
matter in this way, or undertake in this way, but you are supposed to adhere to those aspects of
friendliness with Sugreeva and the affinity earlier existed in dealing with him. [4-31-7]

"It will be apt of you to speak to that reneger Sugreeva with placating words rather
than with caustic remarks, as his sin is no more than flouting the timeframe." Thus Rama said to
Lakshmana. [4-31-8]

That brave one and the slayer of braving enemies Lakshmana thus schooled expediently
by his elder brother about the means of gainfulness, that best one among men proceeded to enter the
city of Kishkindha. [4-31-9]

That right-minded and well-informed Lakshmana who is bent on doing only that which
is agreeable and beneficial to his elder brother, then swallowing his exasperation and wielding a
bow which is shining forth like the bow of Indra, and which is standing out like a peaking mountain
proceeded towards the palace of the monkey, namely Sugreeva, and with such a bow he appeared to be
the peaking Mt. Mandhara and like the Era-Ender. [4-31-10, 11]

Lakshmana the non-defying adherer of Rama, a coequal of Brihaspati-Jupiter, in
intelligence, then mulled over the exact words of Rama to be spoken to Sugreeva, possible reply of
Sugreeva on them, and his own sensible counter-reply to them, enwrapped as he is in a furious fire
fired up by the desire of Rama for Seetha, proceeded to Sugreeva's palace like an embittered
whirlwind aided and abetted by a furious fire. [4-31-12, 13]

While knocking down Saala, Palm, Ashvakarna trees with his might, razing
mountain-crests and even other trees with his strength, splintering boulders underfoot, Lakshmana
made haste through an enmeshed path leaving off one-foot-pathway as with an elephant striding
fleetly, and proceeded swiftly impelled by the mission. [4-31-15]

Entrenched among mountains, impregnated with vanara-army is the magnificent citadel
of the king of monkeys, and the tigerly-Ikshvaku, Lakshmana, has seen such an impassable city,
namely Kishkindha. [4-31-16]

While his lips are quivering owing to rancour towards Sugreeva, Lakshmana saw
formidable Vaanara-s at the outposts of Kishkindha. [4-31-17]

On seeing the most notable one among men, Lakshmana all of the elephantine vanara-s
available in the gorges of mountain have grabbed hundreds of mountain-crests and gigantic trees,
and they are at the ready. [4-31-18]

But on seeing all of them handling assaultive peaks and trees, Lakshmana's fury has
become twofold as with a fire to which much fuel is added. [4-31-19]

On seeing overexcited Lakshmana who is like the Time-god and the Epoch-Ender, troops
and troops of those fly-jumpers quickly fled away in all directions with scare coiling their
bodies. [4-31-20]

Then on entering the palace of Sugreeva, some best ones among monkeys have appraised
about the arrival of Lakshmana, and even about his fury. [4-31-21]

At that time, he who is in a lustful mood, who is in the company of Lady Tara and
who is enmired in privacy, that foremost monkey Sugreeva is unheedful of the words of those bold
monkeys who brought the message. [4-31-22]

Then, as directed by ministers of Kishkindha in order to figure out the mood of
Lakshmana, some of the elephantine monkeys who are frightening just by their appearance, who in
sheen are similar to mountains and dark-clouds have gone out of the city. [4-31-23]

All of those brave vanara-s are armed with their own teeth and nails, all are with
tigerish pride, all are hideous in look and horrendous by their faces. [4-31-24]

Some of those vanara-s are with the might of ten elephants, some ten times more, and
some with vigour matching that of a thousand elephants. [4-31-25]

Infuriated Lakshmana has then seen Kishkindha, an unassailable city, as those
great-mighty monkeys flaunting trees are spreading throughout it. [4-31-26]

All of those monkeys then exiting from the inside of the compound-wall of the castle
and coming underneath of the iron-latches of the castle's gateway, they became visible and stood up
to Lakshmana with their ebullient might. [4-31-27]

On envisaging Sugreeva's blunder and of his elder-brother's expediency, that
sensible one and fury restrained Lakshmana, again went into the restraint of fury on seeing the
monkeys. [4-31-28]

With his long, fiery, and endless exhales and eyes bloodshot in fury, that
tigerly-man Lakshmana is like a fuming fire. [4-31-29]

Lakshmana has become identical to a five-faced serpent as his curvi-bow looked like
the curvi-hood of a serpent, arrowheads looked like the poking tongues of the serpent, and as his
own fervency is proliferating as that serpent's venom. [4-31-30]

Angada succumbing to high despair caused by the scare neared Lakshmana who is aglow
like the Fire of Perdition and like <font color="#B3003A">aadi seSa</font>, the Thousand-hooded
King of Serpents, who is perforce infuriated. [4-31-31]

With his eyes reddened in rancour that highly adorable Lakshmana sent a word through
Angada, saying "oh, boy, let Sugreeva be informed about my arrival," and said this way.
[4-31-32]

"Oh, enemy-destroyer Angada, oh, boy, you may say these words to Sugreeva, 'oh,
enemy-destroyer Sugreeva, distressed by the distress of his brother this Lakshmana has arrived in
your presence and waiting at the door, oh, Sugreeva, the vanara, if you are interested it will be
apt of you to listen to his advise, either by coming here or inviting him inside...' saying so oh,
boy Angada, you comeback quickly." Thus Lakshmana spoke to Angada. [4-31-33, 34]

On hearing the words of Lakshmana Angada is muffled up in grief, and on arriving in
the presence of his father Sugreeva he informed "Soumitri has come." [4-31-35]

Bewildered in his perception at the very sharp words of Lakshmana, mighty Angada
then has gone to the palace assuming a very sad face, and there he firstly saluted the feet of his
father Sugreeva and then at the feet of Ruma, wife of Sugreeva. [4-31-36]

Angada whose vitality is intense clinched himself to the feet of his father
Sugreeva, and later clung to the feet of his mother Tara, and he even clasped the feet of his
paternal-aunt Ruma, and latching on to the feet of his parents then he stated to appeal to them
about the message of Lakshmana. [4-31-37]

Sugreeva, the vanara, who is bound up in drowsiness and dizziness could not
comprehend clearly what Angada is talking about, as he is benumbed with intoxication, and even
numbed down with the torpor of lustfulness. [4-31-38]

The hearts of mobbing monkeys are flustered with fear when they pored over
infuriated Lakshmana, thus they jibber-jabbered so as to appease him. [4-31-39]

And those monkeys on observing Lakshmana instantly raised a hubbub at his nearby
that is similar to a storm of a torrent, thunder of a thunderbolt, and the roar of a lion.
[4-31-40]

With that uproarious noise of monkeys Sugreeva came to his senses, but because of
stupor his coppery eyes are helter-skelter and his garlands and ornaments are topsy-turvy.
[4-31-41]

On hearing the words of Angada two ministers who are agreeable in their advice and
appreciable in their aspect have come along with him, and those two ministers of the king of
vanara-s, namely Plaksha and Prabhava, have appraised Sugreeva that Lakshmana has arrived to
discuss variously about the prosperity and probity. [4-31-42, 43]

Those two ministers sitting around and nearby Sugreeva, who is seated like the king
of wind-gods, namely Indra, on appeasing him with meaningful and expressive words they spoke to him
in this way. [4-31-44]

"Rama and Lakshmana are the brothers who abide by truth, highly-providential, and
though they are worthy enough to rule kingdom for themselves they have bestowed the kingdom to you,
such as they are, they have become your true friends." Thus started the ministers to say to
Sugreeva. [4-31-45]

"One among those two, Lakshmana, is biding at the door wielding his bow, by whom the
monkeys are panicked and venting out alarms shuddering utterly. [4-31-46]

"This Lakshmana, the brother of Raghava, has arrived here at the decree of Rama on
the chariot called his 'endeavour', charioted by the charioteer called 'the word of Rama.'
[4-31-47]

"Oh, merited one, even Lakshmana has ushered this Angada hastily, oh, king, the
precious son of Tara, to your presence. [4-31-48]

"Oh, king of monkeys, such as he is, that brave Lakshmana is sticking fast at the
door with an awning of rancour on his eyes and as if to burn down the monkeys just with his eyes.
[4-31-49]

"You may approach him quickly along with your son and relatives, oh, great-king,
prostrate yourself before him holding him in reverence, and thus let his bitterness be indeed
pacified now. [4-31-50]

"Whatever that virtue-souled Rama says that you have to implement wholeheartedly,
oh, king, you abide by the forthrightness of your promise, stick up for the pact you made." Thus
the ministers advised Sugreeva. [4-31-51]

The readers familiar with critical edition may find only twenty-three verses in that
edition, whereas this traditional version contains forty-eight of them. Twenty-five verses that
account the names of trees, river-flows, beauty of nature etc., extolling nature are here as an
ingredient of epical literature that aim to remind us about the need for a good environment, rather
than to worry about global warming, ozone depletion, deforestation etc.

Rama along with his brother Lakshmana reached Mt. Prasavana while the enthroned
Sugreeva entered the cave-city Kishkindha. [4-27-1]

Mt. Prasavana is pervaded with noisily growling tigers and beasts, mightily roaring
lions, compacted with diverse shrubs and creeper-plants, overspread with many a kind of tree, thus
it is adored by bears, monkeys, baboons, and even by wildcats, and that mountain which is always
sanctifying and tranquil is like a heap of clouds in its shine. [4-27-2, 3]

Rama along with Lakshmana has taken up an ample spaced cave as residence on the
cliff of that mountain. [4-27-4]

Rama, the faultless one and the elder brother of Lakshmana, who is the delight of
Raghu's dynasty, and who made an accord with Sugreeva regarding cessation of activity during rainy
season, spoke these significant and timely words to his humble brother Lakshmana who is the
enhancer of prosperity. [4-27-5, 6a]

"This delightful mountain cave is spacious and breezy, hence, oh, enemy destroyer
Soumitri, let us stay in this during rainy nights. [4-27-6]

"This admirable peak of mountain is embellished with white, black and coppery rock
faces, oh, prince, thus this is fully overspread with diverse ores. Bristling with rivers and
frogs, and brimmed with clumps of various trees along with beautiful and amazing creeper-plants it
is elaborated. It is highly reverberated with diverse birds and filled with the screeches of best
peacocks. And bloomed Maalati and Jasmine bushes, also trees like Sindhuvara, Shirrishika, further
the trees like Kadamba, Arjuna, and Sarja in bloom, are brightening it and it is delightful.
[4-27-7b, 8, 9, 10]

"This pleasant lake of lotuses enwreathed with its blossomy lotuses, oh, prince, is
available not far away from our cave. [4-27-11]

"This cave with its north-easterly slope will be homely for us since the inrush of
rainwater will be less, oh, gentle one, also thus with its upraised westerly portion this cave will
be less of gusts that come from east. [4-27-12]

"The black stone available at the doorway of the cave that looks like a spattered
mound of mascara is broad, even-surfaced, and will be pleasant for a repose. [4-27-13]

"See this mountain peak that looks like a scattered mound of mascara, dear boy,
which rose up like a black-cloud on the sky, and it is an auspicious one for it is in northern
side. [4-27-14]

"Even see this mountain available in the southerly direction as if a white cloth is
spread on sky, which is vying with Mt. Kailash and abounding with many an ore. [4-27-15]

"Also see this river unusually sludge-less, flowing from the wide of the cave and
streaming eastward, spruced up with trees like Sandalwood, Tilaka, Saala, Tamaala, Atimukta,
Padmaka, Sarala, and even with Ashoka trees, and it looks as if River Ganga is flowing in Trikuta.
[4-27-16, 17]

"With the trees born on the riverbank and available here and there in various
shapes, like Vaaniira, Timida, Vakula, Ketaka, and with Hintaala, Tinisha, Niipa, Vetasa,
Kritamaala trees, that river is brightened up, and thus that river appears as a dame finely
bedecked with raiment and ornaments. [4-27-18, 19]

"This river is fairly resonated with the calls of diverse birds in hundreds of
flights, beautified with ruddy gees that are doting one upon the other, and admired by the swans
and cranes upon her highly appealing sand-isles, thus she appears to be a damsel decorated with
jewels with a toothy grin. [4-27-20, 21]

"Somewhere overspread with blue water-lilies, elsewhere with red water-lilies she is
shining forth, and she is also shimmering with the beautiful buds of white water-lilies, somewhere
else. [4-27-22]

"With hundreds of waterfowls cherishing it, screeches of peacocks and cackles of
curlews reverberating around, assemblages of sages bustling about, this gracious river is
heart-pleasing. [4-27-23]

"As if seeded by the wish of some divine creativity the rows of sandalwood trees
that are virtually captivating have sprang forth uniformly, so also, the rows of Arjuna trees too
appear in a similar pattern. [4-27-24]

"Aha! Soumitri, very exhilarating is this locale and we can happily reside here, oh,
enemy-eliminator, we can certainly take delight in this environ. [4-27-25]

"Further, oh, prince, hedged in charming groves that exquisite Kishkindha, the city
of Sugreeva, will not be very far off from here. [4-27-26]

"The melodies of singing and the tunes of musical instruments played and sung in
Kishkindha are heard from here, oh, the best-triumphant Lakshmana, and even the blares of vanara-s
together with their snobbish drumming is heard, hence it is not far away. [4-27-27]

"It is definite that the best monkey Sugreeva must be surrounded by his friends,
thus he must be exuberant, as he won an utmost prosperity in winning back his wife and winning the
kingdom." Rama thus spoke to Lakshmana. [4-27-28]

Raghava having said thus resided on that Mt. Prasavana along with Lakshmana, whereat
many sightly caves and arbours are there. [4-27-29]

Though that mountain is indeed very comfortable, though it possess many objects of
nature like flowers, fruits and waters, indeed, there is no slightest bliss to Rama while he
resided there. [4-27-30]

He felt despondent in reminiscing about his wife who is loftier that his lives, but
who is kidnapped, especially on seeing the moon just risen on the eastern mountain. [4-27-31]

That anguish which is surging high in him has rendered him with a bosom marred with
tears, thereby sleep has no effect on him even if he has gone to bed in nights. [4-27-32]

While pacifying Rama who is pensive and who is always subjected to grief, his
brother Lakshmana who is similarly sad for his brother's sadness spoke these words. [4-27-33]

"Oh, brave one, enough is this anguishing of yours, and it will be inapt of you to
dishearten. All objectives will backslide for them who will be ceaselessly anguishing. That you
know clearly. [4-27-34]

"Oh, Raghava, in the world you are a result-oriented person, and a devotee of gods
for achieving those desired results, you are the theist, moralist, and also the mobilizer.

"You are the only master in all the worlds to undertake certain tasks, and for
achieving results of those humanly actions of yours you worship god, leaving the fruits of your
action in god... you will do your duty as ordained... you are a theist, for you alone are
<font color="#B3003A">tat</font> 'that' 'Supreme Person...' thus you cannot self-contradict
yourself to behave only in a humanly attitude... and then you are bound to be a moralist for you
have all the preceding attributes... you alone are the mobilizer, for none other can accomplish
certain tasks for which you are mobilised by all the divinities and you have also come this far...
[4-27-35]

"If you are much too lackadaisical, indeed, you will not be capable to eliminate the
enemy in war, specially a demon, especially a trickster, let alone all of your daring enterprises.
[4-27-36]

"On completely rooting out that agony then you stabilise your endeavour, and then
you will be able to eliminate that demon Ravana along with his followers. [4-27-37]

"Oh, Kakutstha, you are capable to inverse the order of earth along with all of its
oceans, forests, and mountains, then what to speak of that Ravana, all the more. [4-27-38]

"Look forward to the autumnal season, as this season that has come is of heavy
rains, and thereafter, you will eradicate that Ravana along with his city-state and his followers.
[4-27-39]

"I am just awakening the fast sleeping vitality of yours, no more than rekindling
fire concealed under embers with the timely offerings of flammable fire-oblations." Thus said
Lakshmana to Rama. [4-27-40]

Honouring that expedient and propitious advise of Lakshmana, Raghava spoke this
sentence to that good-hearted and good-natured Lakshmana. [4-27-41]

"What is to be said by an affectionate, amiable and cordial person, also whose
courage is truth itself, that you have said it, Lakshmana. [4-27-42]

"Yes! Distress is retrogressive to all the functions. I am casting-off this distress
completely. As an undefeatable one in my triumphs I am invigorating my ebullience. [4-27-43]

"Awaiting for the kind-heartedness of Sugreeva, and for the kindness of the rivers
in their abatement, I look forward for the autumn remaining true to your words. [4-27-44]

"A valiant one who is succoured will be indebted with some requital on his part, but
besides being unfaithful, if one who does not make requital for all the favours done in his
interest, he will be wounding the hearts of soft-hearted people." Rama said so to Lakshmana,
keeping Sugreeva in view. [4-27-45]

Visualising what Rama said about their waiting for pre-winter season to be candid,
and praisefully making palm-fold at that determination of Rama, and even to clarify his own
opportune viewpoint, Lakshmana spoke to Rama who by his own aspect is a delightful one for a ken.
[4-27-46]

"Oh, lord of people, Sugreeva will be effectuating everything you have desired and
said, not later but soon, hence awaiting autumn you may please bear up these heavy rainfalls,
besides bearing with the idea of disciplining the enemy. [4-27-47]

"Let autumn be awaited while containing your anger, and along with me you may stay
on this mountain which is adored by lions, and spend these four rainy months here like a monsoon
lion, although you are capable to eliminate the enemy at any moment like a lion. [4-27-48]

On sending that great vanara force to east, Sugreeva started to send tried and true
vanara-s to south. [4-41-1]

Sugreeva, the well-informed and brave lord of monkey troops, then beckoned Angada
and the other prominent vanara-s who are valorous ones with full-fledged dash and dare, like the
son of Fire-god Neela, and the exceptional vanara Hanuma, the highly vigorous son of Grandparent
Brahma, namely Jaambavanta, also others like Suhotra, Sharaari, Sharagulma Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya,
Sushena, Vrishabha, Mainda, Dvivida, Sushena, Gandhamaadana, and the two sons of Ritual-fire called
Ulkaamukha, Ananga. [4-41-2, 3, 4, 5]

Sugreeva made the formidably mighty Angada as the chief of those valiant monkeys
forming search party and ordered southern direction for them. [4-41-6]

The king of monkeys Sugreeva gave a picture about some of the highly impassable
countries available in southern quarter that need an introduction to those prominent monkeys bound
south. [4-41-7]

"Search the thousand crested Vindhya mountains abounding with numerous tress and
climbers, then the delightful Narmada river coursing a little southerly to that range, which is
adored by great snakes, along with wonderful River Godavari, as well as River Krishnaveni and Maha
Nadi, and then the greatly auspicious River Varada which is an adoration to great snakes. And the
territories of Mekhala, Utkala, the cities of Dashaarna, kingdoms of Abravanti, Avanti, and
Vidarbha, also thus the charming kingdom of Maheehaka, are to be searched thoroughly. [4-41-10]

"Like that Vanga, Kalinga territories shall be searched along with Kaushika
territories available on their fringes, then cast about the Dandaka forest all over its mountains,
rivers, and its caves, then River Godavari that courses through Dandaka forest, and then the
provinces of Andhra, Pundra, Chola, Paandya, Kerala are to be searched thoroughly. [4-41-11,
12]

"You shall go to the prosperous Mt. Malaya which is crowded with iron-ore mines as
its vast mouths, and with amazing crests and motley flowered forests. Search shall be carried out
on that great mountain in the places that are with the copses of sandalwood trees. [4-41-13,
14a]

"From there you shall go and see the divine River Kaaveri there, a receptacle of
limpid waters, to where throngs of apsara-s will be making pleasure-trips. [4-41-14b, 15a]

"You shall see the eminent sage Agastya, whose resplendence is akin to that of the
Sun, and who will be sitting on the top of that highly resplendent Mt. Malaya. [4-41-15b, 16a]

"And when that great-souled Agastya complaisantly permits you, then you shall leave
that mountain and cross over the great River Taamraparni, a highly cherished river of crocodiles.
[4-41-16b, 17a]

"She whose water is overlapped with amazing copses of sandalwood trees and islands
that River Taamrapani will be drifting for a rendezvous with her much yearned lover, namely the
ocean, as with a young woman who will be coursing to have a rendezvous with her yearned lover.
[4-41-17b, 18a]

"From there, on going to the Paandya Kingdome you shall see a fully golden
castle-door bracing the compound-wall of the fortress, which is decorated with pearls and jewels,
and conduct your search even in that kingdom. [4-41-18b, 19a]

"Then on reaching the southern ocean, and on taking a resolve with regard to the
purpose of your task, viz., importance of the mission undertaken vis-�-vis your individual
capacities to leap the ocean, you reach the glorious Mt. Mahendra. Sage Agastya once penned its one
end in the ocean, and the other end is now visible. That august and best one among all mountains
will be completely golden with marvellous terraces and trees, and it will be steeping into ocean on
the other side of land, and this mountain becomes the jumping-off point for you vanara-s.
[4-41-19b, 20, 21a]

"Mt. Mahendra is glorified with numerous kinds of flowered trees and climbers.
Important gods, sages, yaksha-s and even apsara-s will adore it, and it is overspread with the
groups of siddha-s and caarana-s, and thus it will be heart-stealing for a look. And the
Thousand-eyed Indra will always be visiting that Mt. Mahendra on every auspicious day. [4-41-21b,
22, 23a]

"There is a dazzling island on the other side of the shore of Mt. Mahendra, which is
breadthwise a hundred yojana-s, and which is an impassable one for humans, and you have to search
that island up to its fringes. [4-41-23b, 24a]

"Anywise Seetha is searchable especially there on that island because it is the
dwelling place of the king of demons Ravana, who is the coequal of Indra in his resplendence and
which vile-minded demon is to be rooted out. [4-41-24b, 25]

"But a well-known demoness named Angaaraka is there in the midst of southern ocean
who eats prey by grabbing its shadow when flying overhead. [4-41-26]

"In this way, you should clear your doubts about the presence of Seetha at any
doubtable place by thorough searching, and you have to go on searching somewhere else for Seetha,
the wife of the king of people with infinite vitality, namely Rama, only after getting rid of your
doubts about her possible presence at any given place. [4-41-27]

"On crossing over that isle and after a hundred yojana-s a mountain named Pushpitaka
is there in that august ocean, which is adored by the celestials like siddha-s, caarana-s.
[4-41-28]

"Well-settled in oceanic waters that Mt. Pushpitaka will be shining forth with a
resplendence similar to sunrays on one side and with that of moonshine on the other, and its lofty
crests will look as if they are scribbling on the sky. [4-41-29]

"One of its summit will be golden which the Sun adores, and the other will be
silvery whitish which the Moon adores, and that mountain is unperceivable to the unfaithful ones,
or to the unkindly ones or to unbelievers. [4-41-30]

"Oh, vanara-s, venerate that Mt. Pushpitaka by bowing your heads and search it
thoroughly. Then on going across that inviolable mountain and taking a highly impassable route
there is a mountain named Suuryavaan after fourteen yojana-s from Mt. Pushpitaka. [4-41-31,
32a]

"On crossing over even that Mt. Suuryavaan after searching, there is a mountain
named Vaidyuta whose trees will be all-time heart-pleasing and they yield fruits satiating every
taste. [4-41-32b, 33a]

"Oh, vanara-s, you proceed farther after devouring choicest fruits and tubers
growing on Mt. Vaidyuta, and even on consuming precious honey at that place. [4-41-33b, 34a]

"At that place a mountain named Kunjara is there which will be pleasing both to eye
and heart, on which Vishvakarma built the mansion of Agastya. [4-41-34b, 35a]

"There the golden abode of Agastya will be beautiful decorated with numerous
gemstones, and it measures a yojana breadthwise and ten yojana-s in height. [4-41-35b, 36a]

"There is a city named Bhogavati which is an abode of the snakes. It has broad roads
and safeguarded from everywhere, and thus it becomes an unvanquishable city. Deadly serpents with
harrowing fangs and fatal venom will be protecting it, in which the highly hazardous king of
serpents, namely Vasuki, will be dwelling. [4-41-36b, 37. 38a]

"That Bhogavati city is to be searched for Seetha and on coming out of that city,
you have to search even in the fringes surrounding that city including the intermediate zones from
city to its fringes. [4-41-38b, 39a]

"On crossing over that province there will be a glorious mountain named Rishabha, as
that great mountain looks like a Holy Bull, and it is replete with every kind of gemstone.
[4-41-39b, 40a]

"Whereon the sandalwood trees of ochry-yellowy, lotus-leaf-greenly, sky-blue
colours, and even the most attractive sandalwood trees which will be in the glow of Fire are
produced, that mountain is this Rishabha. [4-41-40b, 41a]

"But never touch those sandalwood trees when you see them, as a genre of Gandharva-s
called Rohita will be protecting that dangerous woodland of sandalwood trees. [4-41-41b, 42a]

"Five gandharva kings, namely Shailuusha, Gramani, Shiksha, Shuka, and Bhabru, whose
resplendence is similar to that of Sun will be residing there. It is also the dwelling place of
those who achieved ethereality by their pious activities, of whom some resemble the Sun, some Moon,
and some Fire by their physique. [4-41-42b, 43]

"From Mt. Rishabha to the terminus of the earth the invulnerable beings who won
heavens will be staying. After that, farther from earth there is the most dreadful world of manes,
namely the abode of Yama, the Terminator, and you need not consider going there. [4-41-44]

"You can go or search only up to this point, oh, the best braving vanara-s, as that
world of manes will be encompassed with an alarming darkness, and it is the capital city of Yama,
the Terminator. After that there is no entry into the abode of Yama for the mortals. [4-41-45]

"It will be apt of you to return quickly on knowing the course of Vaidehi after
thoroughly searching all these places in their entirety, and even in those other places you happen
to see, whether I have mentioned them or not. [4-41-46]

"He who returns before a month and informs that 'Seetha is seen,' he enjoys a
comfortable living on a par with me in high-living and luxuries. [4-41-47]

"He who says so will be more dearer to me than anyone, rather than my own life in
particular, and even if he has committed many misdeeds he becomes my confidant. [4-41-48]

"You are with infinite might and bravery, and you are born in those hierarchies that
have wide-ranging attributes viz., gust of the Air-god, gush of Rain-god, glare of Fire-god etc.
Conjoining your own attributes to them that are already inherited you start off on your expedient
effort, and you search appropriately with a thinking as to how to regain Seetha. [4-41-49]

While a similar disquiet of Sugreeva is prevailing over Rama and Lakshmana, Rama palliatively said this 
to Sugreeva, and even to Tara together with Angada. [4-25-1]

"Deceased will not derive bliss by sorrowful mourning, hence it will be appropriate to arrange for that 
work which is subsequent in this matter. [4-25-2]

"Worldly observances are to be observed, thus your activity of tear-shedding this far is justifiable, 
but after the lapse of time of any individual, it is impossible to activate that individual by any other 
remote activity like weeping.

"Worldly observances are to be observed, thus your activity of tear-shedding this far is justifiable, 
it is impossible to undertake any other ritual work if time is lapsed just by weeping. [4-25-3]

"Fate is the cause of all the worlds, Fate is the instrument for action, Fate is the deciding factor 
for motivation of all beings in these worlds. [4-25-4]

"None is an instrument in motivating someone else to do something or otherwise, none is also a controlling 
entity of others, and even the world functions in its own nature, and that Time is cardinal for that 
world. [4-25-5]

"Time will not transcend Time, neither Time transgresses itself, and on attaining the nature endowed 
by Time nothing can overstep its own Fate. [4-25-6]

"Time has no kinship, thus it has no partiality, there is nothing instrumental to override Time, hence 
nothing can override it, and there are no causative factors to Time that connect through friends or 
relatives, hence all are equal in its viewpoint. [4-25-7]

"But even the mutations brought forth by Time are observable by a perceiver with a clear vision, and 
the virtue, wealth, pleasures are to be perceived as cumulated during the course of Time. [4-25-8]

"That king of fly-jumpers Vali departed from here on attaining his own nature of subtle-soul, and he 
obtained pious fruits connected with his one time actions befitting to a king like, friendliness, courteousness, 
and forgivingness required of a king. [4-25-9]

"That great-souled Vali did not care to safeguard his own lives in combat, and by virtue of his own 
rightness of a true combatant unworried of his life, he acquired heaven. [4-25-10]

"Which course the commander of monkeys undertook is the choicest course of fatality, and hence, enough 
is this sorrowing, and let works incumbent on the present time be undertaken reverently..." So said 
Rama to Sugreeva. [4-25-11]

At the close of Rama's sentence Lakshmana, the eliminator of braving foes, spoke this courteous sentence 
to the disconcerted Sugreeva. [4-25-12]

"Sugreeva, you attend to the funeral rites, to be performed subsequently along with those two, Tara 
and Angada, and arrange for the cremation of Vali. [4-25-13]

"Order at once for substantial dry firewood, likewise for finest sandalwood, for the purpose of the 
exequies of Vali. [4-25-14]

"Bolster up that miserable Angada who is heartbroken, you too should not become frivolous in thinking 
as this city Kishkindha is now dependant on you. [4-25-15]

"Let Angada bring wreaths, different cloths, ghee, oils, as well perfumes and other items that are consequently 
useful in funeral. [4-25-16]

"And Lt. Tara, you go quickly and come readily fetching a palanquin of the dead, for despatch is a merit, 
which is truly worthwhile, especially at these times. [4-25-17]

"Let suitable, proficient and sturdy Vaanara-s be at the ready as the bearers of the litter of the dead 
to carry away Vali." Thus said Lakshmana to Sugreeva. [4-25-18]

Speaking thus to Sugreeva that enhancer of his mother Sumitra's delight and the eliminator of braving 
foes, Lakshmana stepped off and stayed behind his brother Rama. [4-25-19]

On hearing the words of Lakshmana Lt. Tara's mood became hectic and he fleetly entered Kishkindha with 
his mood firmed up to get the litter of the dead. [4-25-20]

Lt. Tara came back in a trice fetching that litter of the dead, getting it carried by gritty and suitable 
Vanara-s. [4-25-21]

That palanquin is having a majestic throne and in similarity it is like a divine chariot which is adorned 
and beautified with figurines of birds and trees in high relief. From all over it is well set in with 
strikingly carved figures of foot soldiers, and it is like an aircraft of the gifted souls, namely siddha-s, 
with grills and ventilators. Well seamed-in are its parts and also spacious it is, and well crafted 
by the crafty craftsmen it has wooden play-hills carved in its walls, and finishing touches with a fine 
artistry of polishing are given to that palanquin. It is elaborated with best ornaments and strings 
of pearls, gems, beads and the like, and even with amazing flowery-tassels. Its cabin's roof is covered 
with an ornamental woodcraft of red-sandalwood. It is well covered over with lots of flowers, and in 
its shade it is like a tender sun, while garlands of red-lotuses are further brightening it. And Lt. 
Tara brought such a litter of the dead. [4-25-22, 23, 24, 25, 26]

On seeing such a sort of palanquin Rama said to Lakshmana, "Let Vali be taken away quickly and funeral 
ceremony be undertaken." [4-25-27]

Thereafter Sugreeva along with Angada and others lifted up and then lodged Vali in the litter of the 
dead squalling woefully. [4-25-28]

Thus setting that deceased Vali who is diversely decorated and adorned with garlands and cloths onto 
the palanquin, then Sugreeva, the king of best fly-jumpers, has ordered, "let the funeral ceremony of 
this noble brother of mine be undertaken, befitting to his magnificence... [4-25-29, 30]

"Let the vanara-s proceed in van strewing various gems plentifully, and the palanquin afterward... [4-25-31]

"In which way the grandiose of monarchical opulence will be conspicuous on earth when kings decease, 
in a similar way the Vanara-s have to immortalise lord Vali now," Sugreeva ordered monkeys in that way. 
[4-25-32]

On performing services to the dead in the same way as ordered by Sugreeva, then all of those vanara-s 
like Lt. Tara and others, have promptly started out hemming round Angada, keening over their dead relative 
Vali. [4-25-33, 34a]

Then all the female adherents of Vali came together and wept saying, 'oh, brave one, oh, brave one...' 
and they repeatedly wept thus for their departed dear. [4-25-34b, 35a]

Lady Tara and all other female Vanara-s, whose husband is dead, followed the funeral procession wailing 
in a pathetic tone. [4-25-35b, 36a]

With the din of wailing of those Vanara females in the interiors of the forest, that forest along with 
its hillocks appeared to be wailing noisily. [4-25-36b, 37a]

Many Vanara-s have arranged a funeral pile on an unpopulated sandy isle, around which brooks from the 
cascades of hills are encircling. [4-25-37b, 38a]

All of those best vanara-s then lifted down that palanquin from their shoulders and stood aside weltered 
in melancholy. [4-25-38b, 39a]

Lady Tara on seeing at her husband Vali recumbent on the bier of the litter of the dead, she then brought 
his head onto her lap, and wailed painfully. [4-25-39b, 40a]

"O, great king of monkeys... o, my consort... my dear... o, meritorious one, o, mighty one, o, my dear... 
see me... why do not you see this grief-stricken creature, that is me... [4-25-40b, 41]

"Though your lives have gone your face is appearing to be highly enchanting as if it has a similar dazzle 
of the sun on dusking mountain, as it had when you were alive. [4-25-42]

"Time-god in the mien of this Rama is hauling you away, oh, vanara, on rendering all of us as widows 
by flinging a single arrow in the fight. [4-25-43]

"These are those female vanara-s of yours, oh, best king, unable to come by leaping and jumping as they 
are wont to, they have come treading a much lengthy way of yours, why do not you mind them? They with 
their faces like moonshine are your cherished wives, isn't it! [4-25-44]

"What for you are not seeing the lord of fly-jumpers Sugreeva, and these Lt. Tara and others are all 
your ministers, oh, king, and even the people dwelling in Kishkindha city have gathered around you and 
sinking down, why do not you mind them? [4-25-45b, 46]

"Bid adieu to these ministers as usual, oh, enemy subjugator, then we all can sportfully wander in the 
woods in voluptuousness." Thus Tara mourned for Vali. [4-25-47]

While Tara is enwrapped in the grief for her husband and wailing that way, then other female Vanara-s, 
who are equally haggard by grief have lifted her up and took her away from the body of Vali. [4-25-48]

Angada wailing along with Sugreeva, started to mount his father's body onto pyre in an involuntary way, 
as his senses are deluged under grief. [4-25-49]

On giving fire to the pyre procedurally, then Angada with dismayed senses performed circumambulations 
in an anticlockwise direction to his father, who is voyaging on a remote avenue. [4-25-50]

On cremating Vali procedurally those best fly-jumpers arrived at the propitious river with auspicious 
waters to offer water oblations to the departed soul. [4-25-51]

Those vanara-s on coming together along with Sugreeva and Lady Tara, and then locating Angada in their 
front, they have offered water oblations to the soul of Vali. [4-25-52]

He whose sadness evened up with that of Sugreeva, and who became one with Sugreeva in haplessness, that 
great mighty Rama effectuated the funeral rites of Vali. [4-25-53]

On cremating Vali of lofty aplomb and manifest-renown and whom the arrow of that Rama, the best of Ikshvaku 
dynasty has eliminated, Sugreeva then approached that Rama, who is with Lakshmana at his side, and whose 
flair equals a flaming fire. [4-25-54]

On seeing that best monkey Hanuma, who is burgeoning to cross over the hundred
yojana-ocean and who is also quickly, progressively, and stupendously maximising his body, the
other monkeys instantly shunning off their sadness, raved and rhapsodized over that staggeringly
mighty monkey, Hanuma. [4-67-1, 2]

Those monkeys available all over there are altogether buoyed up and utterly
astounded, and as with the people who have enthusiastically seen Narayana when He maximised His
physique to tread the triad of worlds in His Trivikrama incarnation, these monkeys too are looking
at Hanuma who is now maximising his body. [4-67-3]

Hanuma who is already an outmatching monkey by way of his energy, has now accrued
added energy obtained through the gladness derived by the way of extolment from other monkeys, and
then he impetuously lashed his tail and oversized himself. [4-67-4]

His physique which is being reinforced with resplendence while all the monkey chiefs
are eulogising him has become unsurpassed in its form. [4-67-5]

Hanuma, the lineal son of Air-god, is now prancing about as with a lion prancing
around a wide-open den of a mountain. [4-67-6]

While he is inflating the face of that clever Hanuma shone forth like a red-hot
frying pan and like the fumeless white-hot Ritual-fire. [4-67-7]

On bestirring himself from among the monkeys, and on reverencing the elderly
monkeys, Hanuma said this, with a spine-tingling sensation in his body. [4-67-8]

"He who is an inestimable one in his formidableness, and an expeditious one in his
meandering in the skies, that Air-god who is the friend of Fire-god will be toppling
mountaintops...... [4-67-9]

"I am the lineal son of that high-speeded, brisk paced, life-sustaining Air-god,
hence I am a coequal to him in flights... [4-67-10]

"Indeed shall I venture to go round the Mt. Meru, which is standing like a broad and
lofty scribe-pawl scribing on the sky, for thousands of times, that too, unremittingly...
[4-67-11]

" Or, shall I venture to skew down the ocean with the speed of my undulating arms to
spiral up its waters, in order to completely inundate the world together with its mountains, rivers
and lakes... [4-67-12]

"Shall I shove up the ocean, the abode of Rain-god, with the speed of my thighs and
calves in order that its underwater beings like sharks, alligators and crocodiles will be shoved up
and spilled all over... [4-67-13]

"Shall I make circumambulations for thousands of times around the Lord of Birds and
the viper-diner, Garuda, while he is on the wing in the sky... [4-67-14]

"Oh, best fly-jumpers, just by my astounding and astonishing impetuosity shall I
venture to start with the Sun who starts his journey of the day from Mt. Sunrise, and shall I go to
Mt. Dusk before Sun, and again shall I venture to comeback even before the sundown towards the same
day's flaming Sun when he is garlanded with flaming sunrays around him in midday, that too without
my touching the land... [4-67-15, 16]

"Shall I overtake all the wayfarers in skyway, or shall I parch down the ocean, or
pare off the earth... [4-67-17]

"Or, shall I pulverise the mountains while fly-jumping on them, or oh, fly-jumpers,
shall I splash out the waters great ocean just by the speed of my thighs while I fly over it, by
which all of its water will trail after my tail... [4-67-18]

"Or, shall I now let divers flowers of every climbing plant and tree straggle after
me when I fly by the sky... then my flight path will become like that of Star Swati and its
constellate stars twinkling in the sky... [4-67-19]

"Oh, vanara-s, shall I make all beings see my northerly ascent to the sky, my
movement across the vast of sky, and my southerly descent from the sky... [4-67-20b, 21a]

"Oh, fly-jumpers, shall I show you a prodigious me spanning the sky like massive Mt.
Meru and flying with a propulsive force as though to swallow the sky... [4-67-21b, 22a]

"While flying self-assuredly shall I swipe at the cloudscape helter-skelter, or
shall I swirl the mountains topsy-turvy, or shall I sere the ocean pell-mell... [4-67-22b, 22c]

"Which forcefulness either the Divine Eagle, Garuda, or Air-god has, mine vies with
that... and no being is tangible who can follow up on me to overtake while I am on the wing,
excepting for the king of eagles, Garuda and the almighty Air-god... [4-67-23]

"Shall I penetrate the supportless sky in a split-second, like an electric-flash
rocketing from a black-cloud in a trice? [4-67-24]

"When I am jumping over the ocean, now my aspect will indeed become like that of
Vishnu who in those days easily paced the triad of worlds just in three paces... [4-67-25]

"Oh, fly-jumpers, I am clearly perceiving by my percipience and the different
strokes of my perspicacity are similarly prognostic... and I avouch that I will descry Vaidehi...
hence, rejoice yourselves... [4-67-26]

"I who am a coequal of Air-god in speediness, and of Garuda in fleetness, can
traverse ten-thousand yojana-s at a stretch... that is my certitude... [4-67-27]

"I will fetch that Elixir from the hands of Self-created Brahma, or from hands of
Indra even if he is wielding his Thunderbolt just on fleetly triumphing over him... or, I can even
bring isle of Lanka itself extracting it from the ocean... thus is my confidence..." So said Hanuma
to other monkeys. [4-67-28]

While that choicest vanara with illimitable resplendence, namely Hanuma, is roaring
out his capabilities in the matter of leaping ocean on enormously increasing his physique, all the
other monkeys are stunned to stare overhead at his aggrandized form and thus they are extremely
gladdened.. [4-67-29b]

On hearing the avouchment of Hanuma, which itself is an annihilator of the anguish
of his kinsmen, then the king of fly-jumpers Jambavanta is very much gladdened and said. [4-67-29b,
30a]

"Oh, brave one, oh, son of Kesari, oh, son of Air-god, oh, dear boy, you have wiped
out the boundless bother of your kinsmen in its entirety... [4-67-30b, 31a]

"The monkey leaders forgathered here are enamoured of your blessedness, and for the
purpose of your attainment of the object, they all obsecrate orisons, devoutly... [4-67-31b,
32a]

"You will leap over the extensive ocean with the compassion of sages, choice of
elderly monkeys, and with the consideration of our oracular teachers... [4-67-32b, 33a]

"Each of us will stay here on one's own single-foot till you arrive, as the lives of
all the forest dwelling monkeys are following you..." Thus Jambavanta blessed Hanuma to initiate
action. [4-67-33b, 34a]

Then that tigerly monkey Hanuma said to the forest dwelling monkeys, "Even so, in
this world whosoever he might be, either animate or inanimate being, he cannot possibly bear the
brunt of my bouncing... [4-67-34b, 35a]

"This Mt. Mahendra is beaming forth with boulders and altitudinal cliffs, and the
crests of this mountain are indeed tough, and even towering... [4-67-35b, 36a]

"Diversely outspreaded are its trees, and divers are its transuding ores, thus this
mountain is shining forth... hence, from the peaks of this Mt. Mahendra I will gain speed for my
kick-start... [4-67-36b, 37a]

"On the verge of my upstart from here for a hundred yojana-s, these sturdy crags are
sure to withstand the impetus of that kick-start... [4-67-37b, 38a]

Then that monkey who is the son of Air-god and a selfsame of Air-god shinned up that
towering mountain Mahendra, as he is an enemy-subjugator about to subjugate the arch rival Ravana,
where that mountain is hedged in with diverse flowers, its pastures are the sweethearts of deer, it
is constrictive with diverse flowers of ever flowering, ever fruiting trees and with the flowers of
climbers as well, and where lions and tigers are freely moving and ruttish elephants love it, and
where the flights of birds are uproarious, and pent-up rapids are clangourous. [4-67-39, 40,
41]

He who is equal in valour to the Paradisiacal Mahendra, that highly energetic and
grand monkey Hanuma ambled on loftiest and towery crags of such a mountain. [4-67-42]

When squeezed by both the arms and hands of that high souled Hanuma, that lofty
mountain trumpeted, as if it is a lion-paw-hit brutish-elephantine-elephant. [4-67-43]

Virtually and widely bestrewn are the heaps of boulders, essentially scared are all
the animals and elephants, and actually rocked are the gigantic trees, and its rapids and
waterfalls have spouted out of that mountain by the impact of foot-stepping of Hanuma.
[4-67-44]

Then, the numerous gandharva couples and the hoards of vidhyaadhara-s even, that are
indulged in drinking and inebriated on that mountain are forsaking those lofty cliffs of that
mountain, and even the birds are put to flight, spanking snakes are completely slouching, and
rising up and falling down are the stones of that mountaintops to each step of Hanuma, and thus
that colossal mountain is desolated. [4-67-45, 46]

With snakes popping up halfway through their snake-pits with their hoods swaying and
tongues hissing that earth-borne mountain Mahendra appeared to be a gleaming mountain with flying
flags. [4-67-47]

While the sages are forsaking that towering mountain as their own scare bewildering
them, that mountain appeared to be one who is desolated by his associates in the vast of a thick of
forest, as a wilting wayfarer. [4-67-48]

And he who is an importantly brave monkey among all the monkeys, an eliminator of
enemy stalwarts, that highly proficient, expeditious, and conscientious Hanuma, on stabilising his
impulses and making soul is quite staid in speediness, he made head away to Lanka, instinctually.
[4-67-49]

Thus, this is the 66th, and conclusive chapter
of Kishkindha Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India.

On sending monkeys to southern direction Sugreeva spoke to a vanara named Sushena
who looked like a massive cloud. [4-42-1]

On approaching and venerating that awesomely valorous Sushena, the father of Lady
Tara, thereby his own father-in-law, king Sugreeva spoke this sentence while adjoining palms in
supplication. [4-42-2]

Sugreeva ordered the superb monkey son of great-sage Mareecha, called Arcishman, to
western direction, who is a surrounded with exceptional and braving monkeys, a coequal to Indra in
his resplendence, endowed with brilliance and bravery and whose speed equals that of the son of
Vinata, namely Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu. Along with him Sugreeva also ordered the
greatly mighty brothers of Arcishman i.e., the other vanara sons of Sage Mareecha, known as
Arcishmaalyaa-s, also called as Mareecha-s. [3, 4, 5a]

"Oh, outstanding monkeys, you shall search for Vaidehi proceeding with two hundred
thousand monkeys, say two lakhs, and Sushena as your leader." Thus, Sugreeva started to speak to
vanara troops. [4-42-5b, 6a]

"Oh, best monkeys, conduct search in the Suraashtra, Baahlika and Candracitra
provinces, including their extensive and delightful rural areas and spacious cities, as well as in
their woods with Punnaaga trees, areas filled with Vakula, and Uddalaka trees and in their
interiors, and even in the thickets of Ketaka trees. [4-42-6b, 7, 8a]

"Oh, vanara-s, search at the blest rivers in the west whose cool water flows
westward, as well as in the forests of sages and on the mountains of those forests, and even in
lands that are virtually waterless and on the highly towering mountains that are chilly. On
searching such an impassable western quarter encircled with enmeshed mountains, then it will be apt
of you to come and see Western Ocean. Having come to Western Ocean, you will see seawater ruffled
by sharks and crocodiles. [8b, 9, 10, 11a]

"Later the monkeys may ramble in the shrubberies of Ketaka plants, in copses of
Tamaala plants and in the boscages of coconut trees. [4-42-11b, 12a]

"Seetha shall be searched along with the residency of Ravana on the mountains that
are sitting pretty on the seashore, as well as in the forests on those mountains. Further, the
delightful cities available alongshore like Muraci, Jaatapura, Avanti and Angalepa are to be
searched together with the forest of Alakshita, including the nearby provinces and spacious
townships. [4-42-12b, 13, 14]

"At the junction of River Sindhu with the ocean, Mouth of Indus, there is a huge
mountain named Hemagiri, Golden-Mountain, which is with hundreds of summits and gigantic trees.
[4-42-15]

"On the beautiful ridges of that mountain flying-lions are inhibiting and they will
be winching sharks, fish and elephant seals to their lairs. [4-42-16]

"The elephants inhibiting on the top of that mountain are contended and conceited,
and trumpeting like thunderous clouds they will be moving everywhere in that vast area of the
mountain abutted by water and near at the lairs of flying-lions. [4-42-17, 18a]

"The monkeys who can change their guise by their wish have to quickly and entirely
search the golden peak of that Hemagiri which will be touching the sky and which has amazing trees
on it. [4-42-18b, 19a]

"On your seagoing there, oh, vanara-s, you will see the golden peak of a waterlogged
mountain called Mt. Paariyaatra, which peak will be hundred yojana-s in height, and which is
difficult to see as it will be blindingly glittering. [4-42-19b, 20a]

"Twenty four crores of mighty and atrocious Gandharva-s whose glow is similar to the
fire and who can change their guise at their wish are living there on that mountain Paariyaatra.
[4-42-20b, 21a]

"If those Gandharva-s who resemble the tongues of fire are given offence, they will
be thronging together from everywhere, as such even awfully courageous vanara-s shall not provoke
them. [4-42-21b, 22a]

"And the fly-jumpers shall not pluck at least a fruit in that province. Because
those assiduous, highly mighty and valiant Gandharva-s are impossible for overtures, isn't it.
Moreover, those appallingly audacious Gandharva-s will be safeguarding fruits and tubers there.
[4-42-22, 23]

"There you have to put yourself in devoir and search for Janaki. In the event of
your following just monkey-hood and its antics, without becoming adventuresome, there will be no
scare from those Gandharva-s. Then you proceed from that Mt. Paariyaatra to Mt. Vajra.
[4-42-24]

"Oh, fly-jumpers, there is a great mountain named Mt. Vajra in that sea beyond Mt.
Paariyaatra. It will be with a shine similar to the hue of the gemstone lapis, and it will be
standing like a diamond in its shape, hence it is diamondiferous. There that glorious mountain will
be soaring high, squarely for a hundred yojana-s, and diverse trees and climbers will be spreading
over it. There, on that mountain you have to search pursuantly including its caverns. [4-42-25,
26]

"In the fourth quarter of that ocean from land a mountain named Cakravaan is there.
Vishvakarma, the Divine Architect, constructed a thousand-spoked wheel on it. [4-42-27]

puraaNa/Legend: "Once upon a time in the crusades of gods-demons, Vishnu assuming
the form of <font color="#B3003A">puroSottama</font> 'Supreme Person' slew the horse-faced demon
named Hayagreeva on that mountain, and snatched away the wheel-weapon from him. Until then, this
wheel-weapon existed under the custody of that demon Hayagreeva. Purushottama also put another
demon Pancajana to death on that very mountain and took away his backbone, which is a conch-shell.
Thus the conch-shell handled by Vishnu is known as <font color="#B3003A">paancha janya
shankha</font> 'Paanchajanya conch.' Thus, this Cakravaan named mountain assumes legendary
importance to search for Seetha. [4-42-28]

"Vaidehi is to be searched on the delightful cliffs of that Mt. Cakravaan and also
in its spacious caves, together with Ravana, and search for her here, there, and everywhere.
[4-42-29]

"After sixty-four yojana-s another very great mountain with golden peaks is there in
abyss of the abode of Rain-god, namely the ocean, and it is named as Mt. Varaaha. [4-42-30]

"A city named Praagjyotisha is there which is completely golden, wherein the
evil-minded demon named Naraka is living. [4-42-31]

"There on the delightful cliffs and spacious caves of that Mt. Varaaha, including
that city Praagjyotisha, Ravana shall be searched together with Vaidehi. [4-42-32]

"On ranging from that best Mt. Varaaha, whose caves are inlaid with gold-deposits
apparent to the naked eye, there is an entirely golden mountain containing waterfalls and rapids
called Meghavanta. [4-42-33]

"Listening the sonorous sounds of waterfalls and rapids of that mountain, and
construing them to be the roars of their opponent beasts, the elephants, wild boars, lions, and
tigers will always be facing that mountain and roaring proud-heartedly all around it, by which that
Mt. Meghavanta itself appears to be roaring, proud-heartedly. [4-42-34]

"On which mountain the distinguished Mahendra, whose horses are green and who is the
controller of demon Paka, is anointed by gods as their king, such a mountain is this named Mt.
Megha, or Mt. Meghavanta, which you have to scour. [4-42-35]

"On going further from that best mountain ruled by Mahendra, namely Mt. Meghavanta,
you shall go to the range of sixty thousand golden mountains. Those mountains are radiant all
around with the tinge of young Sun, and with the resplendence of fully flowered trees which are
wholly golden in hue. [4-42-36, 37]

"There is a unique and kingly mountain in the midst of that range of golden
mountains, which is called Mt. Meru, or Saavrni Meru, to which mountain generous Sun has once given
a boon. [4-42-38]

"The Sun said to that unique Mt. Meru Saavarni in this way, 'by my beneficence
whatever that is sheltered by you, say trees, climbers, rapids, boulders, all of them will
transmute into golden hue, either by day or by night. Even those that reside on you, say gods,
gandharva-s, or demons, they too shall thrive as my votaries and as far as their resplendence is
concerned they will be glittering like gold, i.e., in the ochry golden hue of the eventide.
[4-42-39, 40]

"On their coming to that unique mountain Mt. Meru Saavarni at vespers Vishvedeva-s,
Vasava-s, Marut-s, and the other celestials will bide their time for the dusking Sun, and when they
all have worshipped him, the Sun goes to the Mt. Astagiri, the Dusking Mountain, and evanishes for
all beings for that day. [4-42-41, 42]

"The Sun courses across those ten thousand yojana-s from Mt. Meru Saavarni to Mt.
Astaadri in one and half hours, and quickly reaches Mt. Astagiri, or Mt. Dusk. [4-42-43]

"On the pinnacle of Mt. Astagiri, or the Mt. Dusk, there is a supreme and heavenly
manor-house compacted with multi-storied buildings, which in shine will be similar to Sun and which
is arranged by Vishvakarma, the Divine Architect. [4-42-44]

"That villa is brightened by amazing trees, on which diverse birds will be
twittering musically, belongs to the great-souled Varuna, the Rain-god, who wields a tether.
[4-42-45]

"In between Mt. Meru and Mt. Astaadri there is a gigantic ten-leaved Date-palm-tree,
which is completely golden and shines forth with a marvellous podium. [4-42-46]

"On all those mountains, lakesides and riversides Vaidehi shall be searched together
with Ravana, far and wide. [4-42-47]

"This is where the virtue-knower, an enlightened one by his own asceticism, a
selfsame personality to Brahma and one renowned as Sage Merusaavarni indeed resides. [4-42-48]

"And that sage Merusaavarni who is Sun-similar in his shine can be asked, only on
your prostration before him in veneration, about the tidings of Maithili, and her whereabouts.
[4-42-49]

"On effacing the utter darkness of all the mortal world up to here, the illuminator
of mortal world and the decliner of night, namely the Sun, will go to the Mt. Astagiri, say Mt.
Dusk. [4-42-50]

"It is possible for the vanara-s to go only up to there, oh, best vanara-s, and we
have no knowledge of those sunless and boundless realms available far and beyond. [4-42-51]

"You shall return within a month on knowing about Vaidehi and also about the
residency of Ravana, or on your reaching Mt. Astagiri, say Mt. Dusk. [4-42-52]

"And none shall stay behind for more than a month, and if anyone stays, I have to
exercise coup de grace in his respect. By the way, my valorous father-in-law, namely Sushena, is
proceeding along with you. [4-42-53]

"As achievers of ordered tasks you shall give heed to all of the orders given by
him. He who is highly dextrous and great mighty such a Sushena is my father-in-law, thus he is a
venerable to me, as well as to you. [4-42-54]

"Even all of you are triumphant ones and indeed archetypes by yourselves, but
instituting him as your archetype you shall search the western direction. [4-42-55]

"We all fulfil ourselves in reciprocating him who has done good to us, only if we
can locate Seetha, the wife of the king of humans whose vitality is unlimited, namely Rama.
[4-42-56]

"Even if any other task than this is there, that which shall be conducive to this
task, and which shall also be conducive to time, place and purpose, you shall undertake that task
also on deciding about it among yourselves." Sugreeva spoke thus to the monkeys going to western
direction. [4-42-57]

On hearing the sentences of Sugreeva sedulously, then Sushena and the other
important fly-jumpers took leave of the king of fly-jumpers, namely Sugreeva, and proceeded along
with their individual troops to that western direction which is well cloistered by Varuna, the
Rain-god. [4-42-58]

When Rama's arrow hit him then Vali, the scourger in war, suddenly fell down like a hewed down tree. 
[4-17-1]

He who glittered with pure golden ornaments, that Vali fell down on earth while all of his limbs sank 
to dust, like the flag of Indra when released from its ropes. [4-17-2]

On the fall of that lord of hosts of monkeys and bears onto earth, unilluminated is the earth like the 
welkin that has forsooth lost its moon. [4-17-3]

Though that great souled Vali fell onto earth, neither his brilliance, nor lives, nor resplendence, 
nor his bravery are unfettering from his body. [4-17-4]

That superb and gem-studded golden pendent given by Indra sustained that monkey chief's lives, resplendence 
and brilliance. [4-17-5]

By still wearing that golden chest-pendant around his neck, that brave general of monkeys Vali appeared 
like a black-cloud smeared with the colour of golden sunset all around its edges. [4-17-6]

Even though Vali has fallen on ground his splendour is as though refulgent devising itself into three 
aspects, namely by his body, chest-pendant, and the arrow of Rama, which arrow is given to strike the 
crucial body parts alone, and which is still stuck in Vali's chest. [4-17-7]

That arrow which effectuates the pathway to heaven, now discharged from the bow of Rama has brought 
forth that redemption to brave Vali . [4-17-8]

Then on seeing him who has fallen in war, the one with golden pendant, enormously chested, mightily 
armed, face golden, eye greenish, but who is like a fire extinct of its flame; who is like Indra in 
unassailability and like Upendra in indomitability; and who like Yayaati who has fallen from heaven, 
as well like the sun who falls onto earth from solar orbit when Time-ender flings him at the end of 
era; such as he is, on seeing that son of Indra, who forsooth has fallen, Rama neared him followed by 
Lakshmana. [4-17-9, 10, 11, 12a]

On seeing the brave Vali fallen like that, who by now is like fire with extinguished tongues of flames, 
and who is seeing droopily, those two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, neared him with due honour. 
[4-17-12b, 13]

On seeing Rama and the great mighty Lakshmana as well, he who fell to ground flatly hurt by arrow, and 
whose energy and lives are trifling and vigour trivialised thereby, that Vali spoke these sarcastic 
words in his proper pride to Rama, who is taking pride in this conflict as a victor, which words at 
the same time have meaning, politeness, and self-righteousness. [4-17-14, 15]

"You are a renowned prince with pleasing looks.. but, which kind of death I am getting now, that too 
when I was in the commotion of conflict with another, alas, that ignoble death is owing to you, and 
what merit is achieved by you in this undertaking of yours to kill someone who is facing away from you... 
[4-17-16]

"Rama is high-born, they say, gifted with mightiness, resplendent, pursuer of vows, mindful of mercy, 
delighter in people's welfare, sympathetic, greatly enthusiastic and assertively committed in doing 
good deeds, knower of time-and-action, all these living-beings on earth are thus relating your renown, 
aren't they. [4-17-17, 18]

"To be able to control senses and will, forgiveness, conscientiousness, resoluteness, truthfulness, 
and adventurousness, oh, king, are the aptitudes of a king, and even punishing the wrongdoers, too. 
[4-17-19]

"Concluding that those kingly characteristics will be obtainable in you, and even judging by the noble 
dynasty of yours, I have confronted Sugreeva though Tara dissuaded me. [4-17-20]

"When you have not appeared before me when I confronted Sugreeva my concept was, 'it will be inapt of 
Rama to hurt me while I am combating with another combatant, besides, when I will be unvigilant in that 
fight...' [4-17-21]

"Not known that your soul is put to death, not known that you are the unrighteous flag bearer of righteousness, 
to me not known that you are insidious like straw covered well. [4-17-22]

"I have no knowledge that you are a sinner, one in the garb of a benign soul, and explicitly mantled 
under the garb of probity like ash covered fire. [4-17-23]

"I am non-guilty as I have not committed any misdeed either in your country or in your city, nor I have 
taunted you; I am a vanara subsisting on fruits and tubers and always moving in forests alone; such 
as I am, what made you to torture me when I was not combating with you en face, furthermore, when I 
was involved with another? [4-17-24, 25]

"You are renowned to be a prince with charming looks, oh, king, and indications agreeable to rectitude 
are also appearing on your body. [4-17-26]

"Will anybody born in Kshatriya's family, a learned one in Veda-s, thereby who is rid of ambiguities 
with respect to right and wrong, and who is cloaked in an air of probity, execute such a ruthless deed 
like this? [4-17-27]

"Though born in Raghava's dynasty and renowned as a moralist you are actually amoral, and for what purpose 
you run around with this moral aspect? [4-17-28]

"Influencing, largesse, forbearance, probity, candour, and conquering are the attributes of the kings, 
oh, king, and even punishing the wrongdoers. [4-17-29]

"We as animals live in forests while you are city dwellers, we live by eating fruits and tubers while 
you enjoy feasts and banquets, our nature is such to kill and get killed, thus you and me have no correlation. 
And you, even if you are a man and a prince for humans, you resorted to this animalistic way of killing 
me lying in the wait, thus your action is worse than that of an animal, if not subhuman or un-princely. 
[4-17-30]

"Territory, gold, and silver will be the causes while counteracting somebody, in that case, by what 
you are decoyed into these forests of mine or in the fruits of mine. [4-17-31]

"In the pairs of propriety and compliance, punishment and pardoning, no admixture is exercised in kingcraft, 
for the kings do not conduct themselves volitionally. [4-17-32]

"But, to you your self-interests are primary, and you are a wrathful, capricious, contriver of kingcraft, 
and an impetuous shooting-happy archer. [4-17-33]

"Oh, king, you have no devotion to probity, nor your mind is firm about material gains, but as a free-willed 
one you are distracted by senses. [4-17-34]

"How you are answerable to gentlemen, Rama, when you have done this detestable deed of killing an unoffending 
one like me with your arrow? [4-17-35]

"A regicide, a Brahman-cide, a cow-slayer, a thief, an inveterate killer, an atheist, and an younger 
brother who marries before his elder, all of them will go to hell. [4-17-36]

"A slander-monger, skinflint, friend-killer and one who makes love with his teacher's wife, they all 
go to the worlds of evil-souls, no doubt about it. [4-17-37]

"My skin is unwearable, holy people forbid my hair and bones, and uneatable is my meat for your kind 
of reputable people. [4-17-38]

"Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind 
of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s. [4-17-39]

"Sensible people will not touch my skin and bones, oh, king, nor meats from my body are to be eaten, 
such as I am, a five-nailed animal, I am killed. [4-17-40]

"Though Tara appraised me with truthful and favourable words, I just disregarded her advise owing to 
my own delusion, and gone into the control of Time. [4-17-41]

"With you as her espouser the Earth is not with a correct spouse, as with any lady who is with full-fledged 
chastity, but with a husband who is without rectitude. [4-17-42]

"How are you borne to that great-souled Dasharatha when you are artful, felonious, knavish, disposed 
to a false modesty subconsciously, and an evildoer? [4-17-43]

"I am killed by an elephant called Rama that snapped off its girdle-cord called tradition, that infringed 
the conventions of righteous people, and that discarded the goad called virtue. [4-17-44]

"On accomplishing this sort of unpropitious, unjustified killing, which is condemned by the righteous 
people, what can you say when you meet the godly men? [4-17-45]

"The valour that which is displayed on the unprejudiced few like us, oh, Rama, I do not see that sort 
of valour is shown by you in respect of your enemies. [4-17-46]

"Had you been in combat with me en face oh, prince, you would have been killed by me and by now you 
would have seen the death-god Yama. [4-17-47]

"An unassailable one, such as I am, I am killed by you while you remained invisible on the field of 
fight, as with a sinner bitten by a snake while he is asleep. [4-17-48]

"For which purpose I am killed, intending to do good to Sugreeva is incidental to it, you should have 
assigned me for that purpose in the first instance itself, and I would have brought that evil-minded 
demon Ravana, the abductor of your wife in one day, that too without killing him in any fight, but by 
fastening him by neck, and I would have presented Maithili to you. [3-17-49, 50]

"I would have brought Maithili at your order even if she is lodged in oceanic waters or in nether worlds, 
as with the White Horse of Vedic lore. [4-17-51]

"The fact of Sugreeva's getting the kingdom after my going to heaven is proper, but the fact of your 
killing me in war, unrighteously, is improper. [4-17-52]

"Admittedly the world is this way, and if possible a relevant reply may gently be thought ofabout your 
propriety in killing me..." So said Vali to Rama. [4-17-53]

That great-souled son of a vanara king Vali, whom the arrow impaled and agonised, on keenly seeing Rama 
whose resplendence equals the brightness of the sun, said that much and remained silent when his mouth 
has dried up. [4-17-54]

Thus, Vali who is hit down by arrow and who is collapsing humbly spoke exacting words that contained 
probity, meaningfulness, and expedience, to Rama. [4-18-1]

Then to him who is rendered like a lusterless sun, fizzling out like a cloud that released its water, 
and who became like a quenched fire, to such a best monkey and an unexcelled lord of monkeys who has 
just now imputed Rama with words that are abounding with righteousness and meaningfulness, Rama spoke 
subsequently. [4-18-3, 4]

"Uncaring for probity, prosperity, pleasure deriving, and even for the social conventions, now how do 
you rebuke me childishly in this matter? [4-18-4]

"Unconsulted are the doyens of your race that are intellectually well off and agreeable to your mentors 
about rights and wrongs about your deeds, oh, gentle one, how do you wish to debate with me in this 
matter with your primate's caprice. [4-18-5]

"This earth with its mountains, woods, and forests, even along with the authority to condone or condemn 
the animals, birds, and humans on it belongs to Ikshvaku-s. [4-18-6]

"He who is virtue-souled, truth-abiding, plain-speaking, and the knower of the import of probity, pleasures, 
and prosperity, and the one who is concerned in controlling or condoning his subjects, that Bharata 
is the ruler of earth. [4-18-7]

"In whom both scrupulousness and benignancy are there, truthfulness is firmed up, and valour as evinced 
by scriptures is evident, and he who is the knower of time and place is the king, namely Bharata. [4-18-8]

"Holding his virtuous decree desiring to keep up the continuum of righteousness, we and some other kings 
are wayfaring this earth in its entirety. [4-18-9]

"While that Bharata, the kingly-tiger and a patron of virtue, is ruling the earth in its entirety, who 
is there to conduct himself in an unacceptable way to morality on it? [4-18-10]

"Abiding in our own pre-eminent righteousness, and even abiding by the order of Bharata we punish him 
who deviated from the path of morality, according to custom. [4-18-11]

"As for you, you brought virtue to a state of decadence, rendered yourself reprovable by your own decadent 
behaviour, for carnality alone has become your primary doctrine, and thus you have not abided by the 
conduct meetly to a king. [4-18-12]

"It is to be known by him who treads the way of righteousness that he has three fatherly personages, 
namely his own father, his elder brother, and the one who accords education to him. [4-18-13]

"An younger brother, a son, and a disciple with good characteristics, these three are to be deemed as 
one's own sons, for such matters take base on rectitude alone. [4-18-14]

"The probity practised by principled people is very subtle and highly imponderable, and the soul that 
abides in the hearts of all beings alone can differentiate between just and unjust. [4-18-15]

"Like a blind by birth counselling with similarly blind, you being a vacillant, on your counselling 
only with frantic minded vacillant monkeys, what can you really fathom about right and wrong? [4-18-16]

"I will clarify about the words I have said, but I tell you that it is indeed inapt of you to disdain 
me just out of your outrage. [4-18-17]

"Realise this reason by which I have eliminated you... you misbehaved with your brother's wife, forsaking 
the perpetual tradition. [4-18-18]

"While the great-souled Sugreeva is still alive, you with your habit of sinful acts have lustily misbehaved 
with Sugreeva's wife Ruma, who should be counted as your daughter-in-law. [4-18-19]

"Thereby, oh, vanara, this punishment is imposed on you, for your dissolute sinning in abusing your 
brother's wife, thereby for your transgression of tradition and virtue. [4-18-20]

"I foresee no other kind of control other than punishment to him who conducts himself contrary to the 
society and who is deviant of conventions. [4-18-21]

"As a Kshatriya emerged from a best dynasty I do not tolerate your wrongdoing, and the punishment to 
the one who lustfully indulges with his daughter, or with his sister, or with the wife of his younger 
brother is his elimination, as recalled from scriptures. [4-18-22, 23a]

While Bharata is the lord of land and we are his proxies adhering to his orders, and while you too have 
overstepped the bounds of rightness, then how is it possible to be lenient? [4-18-23b, 24a]

"While ruling righteously sensible Bharata punishes him who oversteps the momentous virtue, and he is 
poised to put down lustful ones. [4-18-24b, 25a]

"As for us, oh, monkey's lord, we effectuate our brother's orders and our duty, and we stand for curbing 
your kind of shatterers of ethics. [4-18-25b, c]

"My association with Sugreeva is as good as that with Lakshmana, nevertheless it betided with an understanding 
to regain Sugreeva's wife and kingdom, and he will give succour to me. [4-18-26]

"I gave a promise to Sugreeva at the time of befriending him in the presence of vanara-s, and how is 
it possible for my kind to dishonour a given promise? [4-18-27]

"Thereby you have to infer that a befitting punishment is given to you, owing to all these great reasons 
that abound with virtue and with supreme value. [4-18-28]

"Anywise, you have to regard the punishment given to you is legitimate, and he whom rectitude guides 
has to render assistance to his friend, in any event. [4-18-29]

"Had you pursued rightness you too would have done the same deed in imposing such a punishment, and 
we hear two verses that are given to the advocacy of good conventions, which the experts of rightness 
have also accepted, and which are said to be coined by Manu, and I too conducted myself only as detailed 
in those verses of law. [4-18-30]

" 'When kings impose proper punishment on the humans who have sinned, they become sinless and enter 
heaven as with the pious souls with good deeds.' So says one verse of Manu. [4-18-31]

" 'Either by punishment or by clemency a thief will be absolved from sin, but the king who does not 
impose proper punishment will derive the blot of that sin.' So says the other verse of Manu. [4-18-32]

"When a renouncer has committed sin like that of the one committed by you, my venerable ancestor Maandhaata 
has given punishment which he desired. [4-18-33]

"Such sin is acquired even by other kings who are unobservant in imposing proper punishment, and those 
kings had to make amends for it at appropriate time, by that propitiation they used to mitigate that 
filth of that sin. [4-18-34]

"Thereby, enough with your annoyance, oh, tigerly vanara, as your elimination is devised righteously, 
and we too are not independent. [4-18-35]

"Oh, brave and best one among monkeys, further listen to another cause, and on listening that important 
cause you will not be infuriated. [4-18-36]

"I have neither angst nor ire in this matter of my eliminating you, or, your reviling me, oh, best monkey, 
but listen to the other point I wish to make clear. People will be capturing several animals, either 
covertly or overtly, with snares, springes and even with numerous contrivances. [4-18-37, 38a]

"Meat eating people will undeniably kill animals, either they are speedily sprinting or standing steadily, 
fully dismayed or undismayed, vigilant or unvigilant, and even if they are facing away, in that there 
is no sacrilege. [4-18-38b, 39]

"In this world even the kingly sages well-versed in virtue will go on hunting, and hunting is no face 
to face game, as such, oh, vanara, therefore I felled you in combat with my arrow because you are a 
tree-branch animal, whether you are not combating with me or combating against me. [4-18-40]

"Kings are the bounteous benefactors of the unobtainable righteousness and propitious lifestyles, oh, 
best vanara, no doubt about it. [4-18-41]

"They the kings are not to be harmed, also not to be reproved, not disparaged and nothing displeasing 
is spoken to them, as they are the divinities conducting themselves in human form on the plane of earth. 
[4-18-42]

"I am abiding by the ethicalness practised by my father and forefathers, but you revile me without the 
knowledge of rightness, just by clinging to your rancour." Thus said Rama to dying Vali. [4-18-43]

Vali is much distressed at heart of hearts when Rama has said categorically in that way, whereby, deriving 
certitude about rightness he found no incorrectness with Rama. [4-18-44]

That lord of vanara-s then replied Rama with adjoined palms, "oh, best one among men, what all you have 
said is that way proper, undoubtedly. [4-18-45]

"Indeed an ignoble cannot disprove a nobleman, Raghava, and with regards to the undesirable and improper 
words I have unwittingly spoken earlier, in that mater too it will be truly unapt of you to make me 
blameworthy, as I spoke them in anguish and ignorance. [4-18-46, 47a]

"You alone are the knower of recourses and their real nature, namely probity, prosperity, pleasure seeking, 
and emancipation; <font color=" #B3003A"><em>dharma, artha, kaama, moksha</em></font> ; and you take delight 
in the welfare of subjects, and your faultless intellect is clear in accomplishing ends by judging the 
causes and effects. [4-18-47b, c]

"Oh, Rama, the knower of probity, I am the one who digressed from the rightness and a forerunner among 
such transgressors, such as I am, give absolution even to me with words abounded with rightness." Vali 
is thus saying to Rama. [4-18-48]

Vali who like an elephant plumped in slough continued to say slowly, with tears fully impeding his throat 
and with an agonised moan, on keenly observing Rama. [4-18-49]

"Also, I neither worry for myself, nor for Tara, nor even for any relatives of mine, as I do for my 
son Angada, the best-virtuous one with golden bicep-lets. [4-18-50]

"Right from his childhood I fondly looked after Angada, and he will be dejected when he sees me no more, 
and he withers away like a lake with its water drained for a drink. [4-18-51]

"He is boyish, juvenile, and the only dear son of mine, oh, Rama, as such that great-mighty son of Tara 
needs your protection. [4-18-52]

"You have firm convictions about practicable and impracticable procedures, and you alone are the protector 
of the good and punisher of the bad, hence treat both Sugreeva and Angada with equal compassion. [4-18-53]

"Oh, lord of men, it will be apt of you to show the same kind of outlook towards Sugreeva, oh, king, 
even towards Angada, which you have for Bharata and Lakshmana. [4-18-54]

"The fault occurring from my fault of maltreating Sugreeva may not light upon that self-reproachful 
Tara, and it will be apt of you to see that Sugreeva will not look down on her treating her as the wife 
his rival. [4-18-55]

"When you indeed approve someone, he is capable enough to govern the kingdom, abiding himself under 
your control and following your heart, why a kingdom, he can rule the earth, why earth, he can even 
achieve the heaven itself. [4-18-56, 57a]

"Though Tara dissuaded me I met with my brother Sugreeva in a duel as though aspiring elimination at 
your hand.." On saying thus to Rama that vanara, Vali the lord of monkeys' paused for a while. [4-18-57b, 
58]

Rama consoled Vali with words that are agreeable to savants and that contain the essence and meaning 
of rightness, while Vali is with an evincible perspective of righteousness by now. And Rama spoke to 
Vali this way. [4-18-59]

"Oh, fly-jumper, you need not be remorseful about your wife, son and others you leave behind, because 
we take care of them... nor you should bother about us thinking that we have arbitrarily eliminated 
you, nor necessarily bother about yourself for committing sins, as we took this decision according to 
rightness and considerateness in your respect. [4-18-60]

"He who administers punishment to the punishable, and he who is punishable and gets punished, both of 
them will achieve the results of cause and effect, where punishment is the effect from the cause of 
wrongdoing, and they both thereby will not be condemned. [4-18-61]

"Thereby, by virtue of the punishment you are completely divested of your blemish, and as contained 
in the scriptures on rightness you attained your true nature, that which is agreeable to rightness. 
[4-18-62]

"Let distress, desire and even dread that abide in your heart be discarded, oh, monkey's supreme, you 
cannot possibly transcend destiny. [4-18-63]

"As Angada has always been conducting himself with you, thus he will conduct himself with Sugreeva and 
also even with me, without doubt." Thus Rama spoke to Vali. [4-18-64]

On hearing the agreeable and assertive words of that great-souled Rama, who is the treader on the path 
of rightness and an absolute crusher of enemies in war, Vali, the vanara, spoke these well-disposed 
words to Rama. [4-18-65]

"Oh, lord, oh, tremendously braving one, oh, Rama, the lord of people, I blamed you when your arrow 
sweltered and rendered me imbecile, thus I blamed you unthinkingly for which I may please be pardoned, 
I appease you for the same. [4-18-66]

The lord of fly-jumpers, king Sugreeva, who by now is replete with every means, then spoke to the tigerly-man 
and the vanquisher of enemy's might, Rama. [4-40-1]

"The mighty vanara chiefs who are guise-changers by their wish and who in sheen are like Mahendra, and who dwell 
in my province have arrived and they are properly encamped too. [4-40-2]

"Those ghastly vanara-chiefs who are a match to the monsters and ogres have arrived with these diversely triumphant, 
terribly victorious and mighty vanara-soldiers. [4-40-3]

"Oh, Rama, these vanara-s are acclaimed for undertaking impossible deeds, and they will accomplish whatever task 
they have undertaken. They are powerful ones who have overcome weariness. They are renowned for their confrontation 
and noteworthy in their manoeuvres. These who are the dwellers on diverse mountains can travel either on earth 
or on water. Such as they are these vanara-s have come in millionfold as your servants. [4-40-4, 5]

"All of them will conduct themselves in orderliness and all abide by the welfare of their king, and oh, Rama, 
the enemy-repressor, they will be able to discharge whatever task entrusted to them at your discretion. [4-40-6]

"Such of those ghastly vanara-chiefs who are a match to the monsters and ogres have arrived with these diversely 
triumphant, terribly victorious and mighty vanara-soldiers. [4-40-7]

"Oh, the manly-tiger Rama, whichever you think fit and seasonable that may be said. It will be apt of you to give 
orders to this vanara force since this has joined up under your command. [4-40-8]

"In fact, this task of yours is known to me in its nature. Even then, it will be apt of you to give them orders 
as befitting." Thus Sugreeva spoke to Rama. [4-40-9]

While Sugreeva is speaking thus, Rama the son of Dasharatha heartily hugged him with both of his arms and said 
this word to him. [4-40-10]

"Oh, gracious Sugreeva, whether Vaidehi is alive or not - it shall be known. Likewise, oh, well-informed one that 
place in which Ravana dwells - it is to be determined, at the outset. [4-40-11]

"Only on knowing about Vaidehi, also about the dwelling place of Ravana, I will order for the timely action at 
that time, that too, after deliberating with you. [4-40-12]

"Oh, chief of vanara-s, I am not the master of this task, nor Lakshmana is, but you, oh king of fly-jumpers, are 
the catalyst and master of this task of searching Seetha. [4-40-13]

"Oh, lord of vanara-s, you alone have to give orders for the right determination of my task, and what my task 
is, oh, valiant one, you are fully aware of it, isn't it. And it is inoffensive of you to issue orders in this 
regard. [4-40-14]

"You are a kind-hearted one. To me you are the second-best one, first being Lakshmana. More so, you are a valorous 
vanara, an intellectual, a knower of the scope of the time and you joined forces with us in our welfare, a partner 
and a patron of ours, and the best one among all those who are aware of our intentions." Thus Rama said to Sugreeva. 
[4-40-15]

When Rama said so, Sugreeva spoke in the presence of Rama and the observant Lakshmana, to a mightiest chief of 
fly-jumpers, named Vinata, who is a commander of vanara army, who is like a mountain in his sheen and who thunders 
like a cloud. [4-40-16, 17a]

"Oh, Vinata, the best vanara, you are an expert in determining the tasks in consonance with time, place and probity. 
Hence, you along with vanara-s, whose glow shall be like the moon and sun for they shall be from the progeny of 
Sun and Moon, and even accompanied with a hundred thousand, say one lakh, other powerful vanara-s, shall go over 
Eastern direction of the earth inclusive of its mountains, woodlands and forests. [4-40-17b, 18, 19a]

"There in the East, the forests, mountains and impassable places shall be searched for the princess from Videha 
kingdom, namely Seetha, and even for the residency of Ravana. [4-40-19b, 20a]

"Search shall be conducted at the riversides of heartening rivers like River Bhaagiirathi, another name for River 
Ganga, and River Sarayu, like that at River Kaushiki, and at the pleasing surrounds of River Yamuna, and on Mt. 
Kalinda, as well at River Saraswati, River Sindhu and at the river whose waters are lustrous like gems, namely 
River Shona, and further at River Mahi and River Kaalamahi which rivers are brightened by mountains and forests 
surrounding them. And the kingdoms like Brahmamaala, Videha, Maalva, Kaashi, and Kosala, and in Maagadha, which 
kingdom has grand villages, and in that way, also in the kingdoms of Pundra and Anga, and in the countries of 
the kings called Koshakaara, and in the provinces of silver mines search is to be conducted. [4-40-20b, 21, 22, 
23]

"While you explore those places in their entirety, thereabout you have to search for Rama's dear wife and king 
Dasharatha's daughter-in-law Seetha. [4-40-24]

"Oh, forest dwelling vanara-s, you shall search on the mountains and in the townships that are steeped in the 
ocean. And you have to search on the peak of Mt. Mandara, where some extensive and unsightly beings are harboured, 
and at places where some other beings live with odd physical features. Some of them have no ears, while some have 
their lips as their ears. Some are with grisly faces like iron-faced-beings while some beings, although they are 
single-footed, yet they are very rapid. While some tribals are unkillable and mighty man-eaters, some other have 
golden complexion, and they will be pleasant in their appearance with towering wisps. Some other tribals who live 
on islands budging underwater as they are raw fish eaters and they are observed upon as horrific man-tigers i.e., 
half-man and half-tiger, like mermaids. All of their dwellings are to be searched in <font color="#B3003A">jambuu 
dwiipa</font>, the tableland that contains <font color="#B3003A">bharata varSa</font>, namely India. And you have 
to go beyond this to other easterly places that are reachable either by mountaineering, or by hopping, or even 
by boating. [4-40-25, 26, 27, 28, 29]

"You strive hard in the island of Yava, which will be splendorous with seven kingdoms, like that even in Golden 
and Silver islands that are enwreathed with gold-mines, in and around Yava islands. On crossing over Yava Island, 
there is a mountain named Shishira, which touches heaven with its peak, and which gods and demons adore. You shall 
collectively rake through all the impassable mountains, waterfalls, and forests in these islands for the glorious 
wife of Rama. [4-40-30, 31, 32]

"Then, having gone to the other coast of the ocean you reach River Shona, waters of which will be reddish with 
deep and speedy drift, and which is adored by siddha-s and carana-s. You have to scout thereabout for Vaidehi 
as well as for Ravana, at those beautiful ghats, say littorals of that Shona River, and in the amazing forests 
alongshore. Then proceed to an island called Plaksha Island. [4-40-34]

"On that Plaksha Island very vast rivers emerge from mountains, but alongshore they have many pleasure gardens. 
You have to search in those gardens and at rivers together with cavernous mountains and forests of that island, 
and then proceed to Ikshu Island. [4-40-35]

"It will be apt of you to proceed from there and see the terribly furious, tempestuous, blaring, and tide-ripped 
ocean called <font color="#B3003A">ikshu samudra</font>, Salt Ocean, and that ocean's islands which will be extremely 
ghastly. [4-40-36]

"That ocean which mirrors a dark cloud and hallowed by great serpents, and which blares blatantly is to be traversed 
only by it shores or tactfully, to avoid shadow-capturing of its inhabitants. There you will see colossal bodied 
demons with everlasting hunger inhibiting that ocean, which demons always capture prey by the shadow of prey as 
endued by Brahma. [4-40-37, 38]

"From there, on going to the disastrous ocean named Lohita, Red Ocean, for its waters are red, you shall see the 
colossal tree Kuuta-shalmali. This island is called <font color="#B3003A">shaalmali dwiipa</font>, Shaalmali Island 
because oif this tree. [4-40-39]

"On that Shalmali Island in Wine Ocean you will be seeing the mansion of Vinata's son, namely Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle 
of Vishnu, which is decorated with numerous jewels, and which in sheen will be like Mt. Kailash, the abode of 
Shiva. This mansion is a construction of Vishvakarma, the Heavenly Architect. [4-40-40]

"Thereabout horrifying and merciless demons of various shapes and similar to mountains in size, called Mandeha-s, 
will be dangling upside down from mountain peaks. [4-40-41]

"Day after day those demons will be falling in water when sun always burns them at sunrise and when the impetus 
of Gayatri hymn fells them down, yet they will be resurfacing and dangling on the mountaintops day after day. 
[4-40-42, 43a]

"Oh, unassailable vanara-s, on your going therefrom you shall see the milk ocean, which will be like a whitish 
cloud in its shine, and even like a pearly necklace while her ripples will be swaying. [4-40-43b, 44a]

"In the centre of that milk ocean there is a white mountain of colossal size, named Rishabha, surrounded with 
closely growing trees ever flowered with flowers of heavenly fragrance. And a lake renowned as Lake Sudarshana 
is also there, which is replete with silvery lotuses whose fibrils are golden in sparkle, and in which kingly 
swans will be scampering about. [4-40-44b, 45, 46a]

"To enjoy frolicking in that Sudarshana Lake the gods, caarana-s, yaksha-s, kinnaraa-s and hosts of apsara females 
will be arriving at that lotus-lake gladsomely. [4-40-46b, 47a]

"And on crossing over the milky ocean, oh vanara-s, then you will be immediately seeing the soft-water ocean which 
will be frightening to all beings. [4-40-47b, 48a]

"There exists a fantastically refulgent Fire in the form of Horse's Face that originated from the anger of Sage 
Aurasa. The victuals to that Fire is said to be that highly speedy waves of the ocean, together with all of the 
mobile and sessile beings of the world at the close of each Era. [4-40-48b, 49a]

"There the high squealing sounds of oceanic beings dwelling undersea are audible, and although they are capable 
ones, they are incapacitated on feeling Fire from the Horse Mouth as such they yell. [4-40-49b, c]

"On the northern province of that soft-water ocean there is a hugely enormous mountain named Jaataruupa-shila, 
Golden Rock Mountain, which glitters like gold and which spreads across thirteen yojana-s. [4-40-50]

"There you shall see then, oh, vanara-s, the lotus-petal broad-eyed thousand-hooded serpent god in black clothing, 
namely Ananta, sitting on the top of that mountain and sustaining the earth on his head, who will be like moon 
in his brilliance and whom all beings hold in reverence. [4-40-51, 52]

"A golden pylon resembling a palm tree with three branches as its heads is established on the peak of that mountain 
as the insignia of that great-souled Ananta, and it will be lustrous with a golden podium. [4-40-53]

"That pylon of palm tree is constructed as the easterly compass by celestials gods, and beyond that a completely 
golden mountain is there, namely the august Udaya Mountain, the Mt. Sunrise, beyond which it is all west. The 
pinnacles of Mt. Sunrise will be touching heavens for their height is hundred yojana-s and that divine mountain 
greatly glitters for it is completely golden, and it is pedestalled with suchlike glittering mountains. [4-40-54, 
55]

"That Mt. Sunrise will be splendorous with well flowered and beautiful saala, palm, Tamaala, and Karnikaara trees 
which are completely golden in hue and which will be glittering similar to sun. [4-40-56]

"On the apex of that Mt. Sunrise there is another pinnacle with one yojana width and ten yojana-s height named 
Saumanasa, which is completely golden and very firm. [4-40-57]

"Earlier while treading the three worlds in the incarnation of Trivikrama, the Supreme Person Vishnu made His 
first foothold on that pinnacle Saumanasa, and the second on the pinnacle of Mt. Meru to tread the heavens. [4-40-58]

"The Sun is by far discernable in Jambu Dwiipa when he rises on this zenithal pinnacle Saumanasa, after he had 
circled the Jambu Dwiipa in a northerly route. [4-40-59]

"There the great-sages with nomenclature of Vaikhanasa-s and Vaalakhilyaa-s will come into view with an ambience 
of luminosity, for those ascetics will be with the resplendence of the Sun. [4-40-60]

"In the presence of which resplendence the eyes of all living beings will become enlightened, and whereat that 
illuminating entity of universe, namely the Sun, will be sojourning, this is that Sudarshana Island, named so 
because it contains Sudarshana lake. [4-40-61]

"On the top of that Mt. Sunrise, and even in its cave and forests of that island Ravana is to be searched, together 
with Seetha. [4-40-62]

"The eastern aurora glows redly because the golden hue of Mt. Sunrise imbricates the resplendence of the beneficent 
Sun. [4-40-63]

"In the beginning Brahma, the Creator, ordained this Mt. Sunrise to be the gateway for the earth to heaven, and 
even as the rising place for the Sun, as such this is verily said as the 'eastern quarter' of the compass. [4-40-64]

"Ransack that mountain's peak, even thereabout the rapids and caverns of that mountain for Vaidehi, and even for 
Ravana. [4-40-65]

"Beyond Mt. Sunrise the eastern quarter is impassable. It will be hemmed in with gods since it the gateway to 
heaven, and everything is imperceivable hedged in oblivion, since it will be void of both Sun and Moon. [4-40-66]

"Janaki shall be scouted out on all those mountains, caverns and forests that are indicated by me, and even at 
places that are not indicated by me. [4-40-67]

"It is possible for the vanara-s to go only up to there, oh, best vanara-s, and we have no knowledge of those 
sunless and boundless realms available far and beyond. [4-40-68]

"You shall comeback within a month on finding out Vaidehi and the residency of Ravana after your reaching Mt. 
Sunrise. [4-40-69]

"And none shall stay behind for more than a month, and if anyone stays I have to exercise coup de grace. So, you 
shall return with your purpose accomplished in exploring for Maithili. [4-40-70]

"On searching the eastern quarter expertly, which quarter is cherished by no less than Mahendra and which is circuited 
by the grooves of forests, and on attaining Seetha, the dear wife of the one born in Raghu's dynasty, namely Rama, 
and on returning from that Far East, you all may livelong happily." Thus Sugreeva addressed the vanara-s that 
are being sent to East under the leadership of Vinata. [4-40-71]

On receiving all those gifts brought in by the Vanara-s from Himalayas, Sugreeva dispersed them all with approbation. 
[4-38-1]

On dispersing thousands of monkeys who have effectuated their errand of summoning all monkeys on the earth, Sugreeva 
deemed that his own aspirations and as well as those of that great-mighty Rama are achieved. [4-38-2]

Gladdening Sugreeva who is indomitably mighty and the indomitable one among all vanara-s, Lakshmana spoke these 
courteous words to him, "oh, gentle one, if it please you, make an exit from Kishkindha." [4-38-3, 4a]

On hearing the courteous words of Lakshmana Sugreeva is extremely pleased and he indeed spoke this sentence to 
him, "So be it. Let us go. I remain biddable in your command." [4-38-4b, 5]

Sugreeva speaking thus to Lakshmana, whose person itself is auspicious, then bade adieu to Lady Tara and the other 
female vanara-s. [4-38-6]

Sugreeva shouted sharply saying, "come here," at the best monkey-adjutants and on hearing his call all of those 
monkeys that are spared to see the ladies of palace chambers have come there swiftly with their palms adjoined 
in supplication. [4-38-7]

Then the king Sugreeva whose refulgence is kindred to that of sun has said to those vanara-s that have arrived 
there, "oh, vanara-s, immediately position my palanquin before me." [4-38-8b, 9a]

On hearing his words those monkeys who are the adept ones in their agility right away brought an exquisite palanquin 
and readily started to position it at his nearby. [4-38-9b, 10a]

And on seeing palanquin positioned at his nearby the king of monkeys Sugreeva said to Saumitri, "you mount it, 
Lakshmana, be quick." [4-38-10b, 11a]

Saying so Sugreeva got into that golden carriage which in shine is like the sun and which has many monkey-carriers 
along with Lakshmana. [4-38-11b, 12a]

Sugreeva who achieved the kingdom of unexcelled magnificence has started out that magnificently to the high extolment 
of panegyrists, while a white royal-parasol spread overhead the palanquin, white fur-fans fanning him from all 
over, and while conch-shells are blowing loud and drums are drumming high. [4-38-12b, 13, 14a]

Sugreeva travelled thus surrounded with many hundreds of vanara-s, who look confrontational and who wielded weapons, 
to the place where Rama is staying. [4-38-14b, 15a]

On reaching the province where Rama is staying in all his adoration to that place, the great-resplendent Sugreeva 
descended the palanquin along with Lakshmana. [4-38-15b, 16a]

When Sugreeva reached Rama he stood still with adjoined-palms, and when he remained still with palm-fold all the 
other monkeys stood still with palm-fold. [4-38-16b, 17a]

Rama became exultant of Sugreeva on seeing the massive army of Vanara-s which is just like a vast lake plethoric 
with buds of lotuses. [4-38-17b, 18a]

Raghava raised and tightly hugged the king of monkeys Sugreeva, who has prostrated himself with his head touching 
the feet of Rama, with care and credit. [4-38-18b, 19a]

After hugging Sugreeva that virtue-souled Rama then said to him, "be seated." Then on seeing Sugreeva who took 
seat on ground Rama spoke to him. [4-38-19b, 20a]

"He alone is the king, oh, valiant Sugreeva, who always divides time for devoting himself to probity, prosperity 
and pleasure-seeking. [4-38-20b, 21a]

"If one devotes himself to pleasure-seeking alone, casting off the probity and like that the prosperity also, 
he is like the one who slept on a treetop who awakens only after falling down. [4-38-21b, 22a]

"And the king who is bound up in eliminating unfriendly ones and bound up with forgathering friends, he will be 
enjoined with righteousness, and he even becomes the real enjoyer of the fruit of threefold virtues, namely
<font color="#B3003A">dharma, artha, kaama</font> - probity, prosperity and pleasures. [4-38-22b, 23a]

"Oh, enemy-eliminator, time for endeavour has come, oh, king of monkeys, let this be discussed along with your 
monkey-ministers." Thus Rama spoke to Sugreeva. [4-38-23b, 24a]

When Rama addressed him in this way, Sugreeva said these words to Rama, "oh, dextrous Rama, by your beneficence 
I have repossessed prosperity, popularity and this everlasting kingdom of monkeys which are actually mislaid. 
[4-38-24b, 25]

"Oh, god, by your and your brother's benevolence alone I regained what I lost, oh, victorious one among victors, 
and he who does not requite the favour that has been done for him will become the vitiator of probity among men. 
[4-38-26]

"These are the hundreds of vanara chiefs, oh, enemy-subjugator, who have just returned on forgathering all of 
the forceful vanara-s on earth. [4-38-27]

"Oh, Raghava, the legatee of Raghu, those vanara-s with dreadful appearance, and who are the experts in permeating 
the impenetrable forests, woodlands and impassable mountains are coming. And the bears, monkeys and brave baboons 
who are the children of gods and gandharva-s, and who change their guise just by their wish are halfway through 
on their path duly fenced round with one's own forces. [4-38-28, 29]

"Oh, king, some of the fly-jumpers that are arriving are with a hundred-legion, some with a hundred-thousand legion, 
and even some with millions of legions, while the some are on the way with specific legions like aayuta-s, shanku-s. 
And oh, valiant one Rama, some with legions of arbuda-s, and some with hundreds of arbuda-s, some with madhya-s, 
and some with antaH-s are coming. Some more are coming with samudra-s and some with paraardha-s legions of monkeys. 
Oh, enemy-flamer Rama, the legions of monkeys along with their monkey commanders who are viable to Mahendra in 
valour, and who compare with massive clouds and mountains, and who domiciled on Mt. Meru and Mt. Vindhya will 
be coming in your service. [4-38-30, 31, 32]

"Those vanara-s who are combative in wars, and those who can fetch Maithili on eliminating Ravana in war, will 
be approaching you soon." Thus Sugreeva informed Rama. [4-38-33]

Then on seeing the perfect effort made by the prominent one among all monkeys, Sugreeva, who is operating under 
his control, the eyes of valorous prince Rama are widened in jubilance, like the well-bloomed blue-lotuses. [4-38-34]

A word about this chapter. The bardic tradition is in the habit of including everything, while the critical 
editions exclude anything arbitrary. This chapter is excluded in the critical editions, but traditional 
versions retained it, and all publications publish this. The scholars have also said that all the forty-four 
verses in here have no stamp of Valmiki, the verbiage and verbosity are heightened, even the meter is 
overfilled, and even the word positioning does not yield proper meaning. Even so, all are retained in 
all publications. However, it may be mentioned that if some Valmiki Jr. written and included this chapter, 
it should have been ages before, but not in the known ages, because Dharmaakuutam, Govindaraja and others 
have commentaries on chapter. In all the commentaries an exhaustive commentary is there on two verses 
uttered by Tara, which is included here also.

On seeing Tara who quickly deluged in a speedy and vast ocean of intolerable anguish, then that Vali's 
mighty brother Sugreeva regretted for the killing of his matchless brother. [4-24-1]

While that kind hearted Sugreeva observed Tara for a moment he is despaired at heart, tears filled his 
face, and lamenting very much he slowly paced to the near of Rama, surrounded by his attendants. [4-24-2]

On approaching him who is majestic, who is still handling his bow and snake-like arrow, a distinguished 
person with all of his limbs adorned with great attributes that an emperor should have by birth, to 
such a Raghava who is standing nearby, Sugreeva spoke this way. [4-24-3]

"As promised, oh, best king, you have accomplished this deed with its eventual fruition of getting back 
the kingdom and my wife, but now, oh, prince, my heart is backsliding from extravagances of kingdom 
and kingship, as my life itself is rendered despicable, for I got my brother killed. [4-24-4]

"When the king is killed, this empress is wailing bitterly, much wailing is there in city scorched in 
sadness, and Angada too is in a doubtful state of sustaining his lives in the fond of his father, as 
such oh, Rama, my heart is not taking delight in kingdom. [4-24-5]

"In the first instance I have agreed for the elimination of my brother owing to my anger, intolerance 
and as I was subjected to too much ignominy, but now, oh, best one from Ikshvaku-s, when the chief of 
monkeys Vali is put to death, I am painfully remorseful. [4-24-6]

"I think it would be better for me to live on that best mountain Rishyamuka for ever in an as is where 
is condition, somehow spending life befitting to a monkey, and achieving even heaven on killing my brother 
is of no good. [4-24-7]

"The words which he used to speak to me saying, 'I do not wish to kill you, begone...' are befitting 
to that great-souled and rational vanara, and my words in asking you to him to kill him, and my deeds 
in getting him killed are befitting to me, as an irrational vanara. [4-24-8]

"Indeed, oh, brave Rama, whether killing one's own brother will be self-torturous? Or, taking pleasure 
in kingdom on killing that brother will be more? Or, the distress ensuing that killing will be the most? 
Without truly discriminating these cruces, even if one has one's own own avarice in prospect, who is 
he that is going to take pleasure in killing his own highly honoured brother? Excepting me! [4-24-9]

"Killing me is not in the intent of Vali violating his probity, but my intent has become evilly life 
taking, violating my own probity. [4-24-10]

"I was whining for a time when Vali thrashed me with a tree branch, as if with a schoolmaster's cane, 
but later on comforting me he said this to me, 'do not do this again, this daring me to fight you back.' 
[4-24-11]

"Fraternity, dignity and also probity are conserved by him, while I exhibited furiousness, enviousness 
and also naughtiness of a monkey. [4-24-12]

"As Indra acquired sin on killing Vishvarupa, the son of Tvastha, I too derived a sin by killing my 
brother, which sin is absolutely unimaginable for quantification, totally undesirable at any given time, 
wholly discardable by sagacious souls, and a disgustingly horrible spectre of brotherly hate. [4-24-13]

"Earth, waters, trees and women took the burden of Indra's sins, but who in name will bear the burden 
of this sin of mine, that too the sin of a monkey, who wishes to share? [4-24-14]

"On undertaking this sort of deed that includes unjust and involves ruination of one's own race, I am 
unsuited for this sort of accolade from the subjects of this kingdom, and when I am ineligible to be 
the price regent of this kingdom, wherefore to become its regent? [4-24-15]

"In this world, I am a committer of a felony which is debased, highly damnable and pernicious to the 
world itself, whereupon this irresistible misery is rushing in on me, as with the rush of speeding rainy-waters 
towards a declivity. [4-24-16]

"The sin of mine in killing my brother assumed a form of an elephant, where my sinister motives of killing 
my own brother have assumed that elephant's hind and tail, and my causing agony to my own brother has 
become that elephant's head, eyes, trunk, and tusks, with them that berserk and monstrous elephant called 
sin, is goring me as it would gore a riverbed. [4-24- 17]

"How difficult is this insufferable sacrilege of mine, oh, best king, owing to which my good breeding 
is shed from my heart, as with the gold, which if alloyed will be intolerant of that filth, but oh, 
Raghava, even the gold sheds itself from scum when melted, and though I melt in grief this scum of sacrilege 
is unshed. [4-24-18]

"I think this body of great-might monkey commanders is withstanding its lives in a halfway, oh, Raghava, 
just because of me and this Angada who is searing in anguish, for it is half-dead with the death of 
Vali. [4-24-19]

"It is easy to get an easygoing and easy to deal with son, but where to get a son similar to Angada, 
oh, valiant Rama, also where to get even such a place wherein there will be an easy access to the nearness 
to one's own brother?

It is somehow easy to get a son who is an easygoing, easy to deal with like Angada in this world, but, 
oh, valiant Rama, where is the world wherein I can get Vali-like brother and wherein can be in his vicinity? 
[4-24-20]

"This best of brave ones, Angada, will not live reft of his father, but his mother Tara has to live 
to foster her son Angada, but if Angada dies with his heartbroken for his farther, then without her 
son her misery will become miserable, and then she too may not live... this is my resolve. [4-24-21]

"Such as I am, I wish to enter a highly blazing fire seeking amity with my departed brother and as well 
with son Angada, and these best valiant monkeys will search for Seetha duly conducting themselves under 
your control. [4-24-22]

"Oh, prince, even if I am dead your mission will be achieved in its entirety, and oh, Rama, having perpetrated 
infraction I have become an eliminator of the propriety of our race, hence I have become an unworthy 
one to live, and hence permit me to commit myself to fire..." Thus Sugreeva said to Rama. [4-24-23]

On hearing the anguished words of the younger brother of Vali, namely Sugreeva, the eyes of Rama, the 
best valiant one from Raghu's dynasty and the eliminator of valiant enemies, are moistened and he became 
perturbed for a moment. [4-24-24]

At that moment, Rama whose perseverance is like that of the earth and who is the protector of earth 
has seen Tara, who is wailing and repeatedly looking around as she is deluged in desperation, and then 
with all his concernedness Rama paced towards her. [4-24-25]

The prominent monkey ministers then started to raise her up, whose eyes are pleasant and intellect unfailing, 
and who had the lion among monkeys as her husband, but now collapsed on ground hugging her departed 
husband. [4-24-26]

She who is hugging her husband wriggled highly when she is disengaged from him, and at a particular 
stage she saw Rama with his bow and arrow in his hands and who is resplendent like sun, by his own resplendence. 
[4-24-27]

On seeing at him whose eyes are graceful, one endowed with all kingly attributes, who looked best among 
men, and who is unseen so far, that fawn-eyed Tara realized him alone as that Rama. [4-24-28]

She on whom misfortune has chanced and who is anguished, that noble lady Tara went very quickly with 
highly squirming movements to the near of the highly exalted soul Rama, who matches Indra in his valour 
and an unreachable one for his enemies. [4-24-29]

The body language of Tara which is so far disconcerted by the grief felt for Rama's perfect hitting, 
felling and achieving his object in war, namely Vali, is now disoriented to anger on seeing the very 
same Rama, as she is a self-respectful lady. But on arriving at the near of that very pure being Rama, 
that ireful body language of hers again reoriented itself to a sort of serenity, and then she spoke 
this to him. [4-24-30]

"You are an indeterminable one, an inaccessible one, one with his self conquered, the supreme among 
righteous souls, your glory is unmitigated, and you are the one with clear discrimination, and in endurance 
earth-like, and your eyes are blood streaked like those of an emperor. [4-24-31]

"You with your proportionate physic are a mighty one handling 
bows and arrows, but your bodily magnificence is more than that of magnificent humanly body. 


"You with your proportionate physic are a mighty one handling 
bows and arrows, but your bodily magnificence is more than that of magnificent humanly body. [4-24-32


"Oh, brave one, kill me too with the same arrow with which you have killed my dear husband, and on getting 
killed at your hand I wish to reach his near, as Vali takes no delight without me. [4-24-33]

"Though Vali with eyes like unblemished lotus petals reaches heaven he looks around for me, and not 
finding me there, he does not have a romance with celestial apsara-s though they will be in amazing 
costumes and wear red-coloured towering tiaras. [4-24-34]

"Even though Vali is in heaven he will derive despair and despondency without me, like you, who are 
despondent and despaired on the pleasant stretches of mountainsides of that best mountain Rishyamuka, 
as you are without Seetha. [4-24-35]

"How a virile person derives discomfort without his woman, that much you know, isn't it! Because you 
are aware of it, you kill me; let not Vali get any discomfort when he does not find me. [4-24-36]

"Oh, prince, as a high souled one even if you think that, "sin of killing a female will not befall on 
me?" But deem me as his soul, as scriptures say that the wife is the soul of husband, and hence kill 
me, then there will not be any blemish of woman killing. [4-24-37]

"In the course of implementing scriptural rituals, and even as contained in various Vedic sayings, wife 
is not a separate entity than her husband, and no better endowment than endowing a wife to an eligible 
bridegroom by bride's father is countenanced by the wise men in the world, isn't it. [4-24-38]

"Even you, oh, valiant one, on examining good and bad bestow me to my dear husband, and by that way, 
oh, brave one, by such an endowment of a wife to her husband, by way of killing and sending her to her 
husband, you too will not get any touch of sin. [4-24-39]

"Anguished and unprotected, such as I am, oh, king, I am being distracted from my departed husband by 
these Vanara misters, and it is unapt of you to not to kill me, as I am incapable to live without him, 
whose sprightly gait is like that of an elephant, a best one among fly-jumping Vanara-s, a courageous 
one, and who wears a precious and exquisite golden pendant..." Thus Tara pleaded with Rama for a mercy-death. 
[4-24-40]

Thus that way when Tara spoke to that lord and great-souled Rama, Rama consoling Tara well, spoke this 
word of expediency, "oh, wife of valiant one, let not your mind go raving, the Creator decreed all the 
world to be in this way, isn't so! [4-24-41]

"And the same Creator has ordained mirth and misery , and even their association, so say sagely people. 
And even the triad of worlds is indeed under his control, and that triad too, cannot transgress the 
foreordained predestination. [4-24-42]

"You will get paramount appeasement as before, and your son will become the crown prince, God has ordained 
destiny only in that way. Wives of the valiant ones will not mourn emotionally." Thus Rama consoled 
Tara. [4-24-43]

Thus consoled by that persuasive, noble-souled and enemy-burner Rama, that brave one's wife whose aspect 
is fair and whose attire is proper, she paused her plaint, but with a puling expression. [4-24-44]

On sending his father-in-law, namely Susheshana, to westerly direction then the king
of Vanara-s Sugreeva, spoke to a valorous vanara named Shatabali. [4-43-1]

That knowledgeable and the powerful one among all monkeys, King Sugreeva, spoke
words to Shatabala that are advantageous to himself, and beneficial to Rama as well. [4-43-2]

"Accompanied with a hundred thousand forest-dwelling monkeys of your kind, and also
with all of your ministers who the sons of Yama, the Terminator, you have to proceed. [4-43-3]

"Oh, venturesome Shatabala, you scout out whole of the northern quarter that has
snowy Himalayan mountains as its crown for the glorious wife of Rama. [4-43-4]

"Oh, enterprising vanara-s, when this mission is complete and when we can effectuate
a task agreeable to Rama, we will become debt-free and accomplished of our purpose. [4-43-5]

"Great-souled Raghava has indeed done a favour to us, isn't it. If there is
reciprocation to that kind deed, our lives will become fruitful. [4-43-6]

"He who completes the deed of a requester, even though that requester has not
rendered any hep earlier, his life becomes fruitful. Then what is there to say again about him who
has already received help from the requester? [4-43-7]

"Let all of you abide by such a thinking as you are the well-wishers of our
well-being and welfare, and undertake your mission in such a way as to how Seetha can be found in
your search. [4-43-8]

"On his part this Rama, who is the best on among men and the champion of enemies'
fastnesses, is the estimable one for all beings, and his interests have indeed fell in with ours.
[4-43-9]

"Let all of you with your assets of wisdom and valour rake over all of these
impassable places, rivers, mountains and also their canyons. [4-43-10]

"There in the north, the provinces of Mleccha-s, Pulinda-s, that way Shurashena -
Prasthala - Bharata - Kuru - Madraka - Kaambhoja - Yavana shall be scrutinized along with the
cities of Shaka and Darada, and then search in Himalayas. [4-43-11,12]

"In the stands of Lodhra trees, Padmaka trees and in the woods of Devadaru, or
Deodar trees, Ravana is to be searched there and there, together with Seetha. [4-43-13]

"You to Soma hermitage, which is adored by the gods and gandharva-s, and then you go
to that great-peaked mountain named Mt. Kala. [4-43-14]

"On its cliffs, mountainsides and in caves the highly fortunate and impeccable wife
of Rama shall be searched. [4-43-15]

"On going across that lordly mountain Kala, which great-mountain is impregnated with
gold, it will be apt of you to go to the mountain named Sudarshana afterwards. [4-43-16]

"Latter there will be a mountain overspread with various birds and adorned with
varied trees named Devasakha which is a sanctuary for birds. [4-43-17]

"Let Ravana be quested after in the segments of woods, at waterfalls, and even in
caverns of that mountain, together with Vaidehi. [4-43-18]

"On crossing Mt. Devasakha, there is a vacant land to a span of hundred yojana-s all
around, which is devoid of mountains, rivers and even trees, and discarded by all beings.
[4-43-19]

"But you all will be overjoyed on traversing that hair-raising wasteland quickly and
on attaining Mt. Kailash. [4-43-20]

"There is the delightful mansion of Kubera, which in shine will be like a silver
cloud and processed with gold, and the Divine Architect Vishvakarma has constructed it.
[4-43-21]

"Where an expansive lake is there, which is replete with lotuses and costuses,
overrun by swans and partridges, and adored by throngs of apsara-s, that is the place of Kubera,
Deity for Wealth-Management. [4-43-22]

"The son of Sage Vaishravana and king of yaksha-s, who is reverenced by all beings
for he is the money giver, that fortunate king will be rejoicing there along with guhyaka-s, viz.,
yaksha-s. [4-43-23]

"Ravana shall be searched on Mt. Kailash, and even in the caves of nearby mountains
which will be shining like moon, together with Vaidehi. [4-43-24]

"Thereafter on reaching Mt. Kraunca you shall cautiously enter into a highly
impassable tunnel of that mountain to search Seetha. That tunnel, they say, is an un-enterable one.
[4-43-25]

"In that tunnel great-souled sages reside at the request of gods, and those
great-sages are similar to Sun in their resplendence and godly in their mien. Even then, you search
for Ravana therein that tunnel. [4-43-26]

"Besides the main peak of Mt. Kraunca, its other peaks, terraces, crevices and
midriffs shall be searched, far and wide. [4-43-27]

"The treeless Mt. Kaama and the abode of birds Mt. Maanasa are also to be searched,
and there is no inlet for any being, let alone gods or demons. [4-43-28]

"You all have to search Mt. Kraunca inclusive of its mountainsides, grades, and its
fringe mountains, and on moving away from that Mt. Kraunca, a mountain named Mainaaka is there.
[4-43-29]

"The mansion of the demon Maya is there which is built by himself and that Mt.
Mainaaka is to be searched out, inclusive of its crests, grades and caves. Thereabout the dwellings
of horse-faced females, namely KimpuruSa-s, are there and you have to search them also. [4-43-30,
31a]

"On crossing over that province there is the hermitage adored by siddha-s, the
resolved-souls. There the sages, namely siddha-s, vaikhaanasa-s, and vaalakhilyaa-s will be there.
[4-43-31b, 32a]

"Then you venerate those sages with accomplished souls, whose asceticism alone has
effaced their blemishes, and you may even humbly ask them after Seetha's whereabouts. [4-43-32b,
33a]

"There is the lake belonging to Vaikhaanasa sages, overspread with golden lotuses,
and overrun with prosperous swans whose resplendence will be similar to the tender sun. [4-43-33b,
34a]

"The carrier elephant of Kubera known as Saarvabhauma will always be visiting that
place along with she-elephants. [4-43-34b, 35a]

"Passing that lake there will be just sky which will be devoid of moon, or sun, or
the clusters of stars, and it will be cloudless and noiseless. [4-43-35b, c]

"That place will be luminescent with the self-resplendence of godlike sages who have
accomplished their asceticism and who are taking rest at that place, as if illuminated with
innumerable rays of the sun. [4-43-36]

"On crossing over that province there is a deep flowing river named Shailoda. On
both of its riverbanks bamboo brakes called as Keecaka-s will be there. Those bamboos will be
enabling the movement of siddha-s, accomplished souls, from one bank to the other. [4-43-37,
38a]

"Then there is the North Kuru, the dwelling of those who have achieved divine merit
in their previous births and now born in that country to enjoy the fruits of that divine merit,
thus that country itself is earmarked for meritorious beings. At that place, the lotuses in the
rivers will be golden in hue. The runners and stalks of lotus plants bear lotus-leaves that are
bluish like the bluishness of lapis lazuli. There will be thousands of such rivers filled with such
plants in water, and with waters mingled with the waters of other lakes, and decorated with the
thickets of red Costuses alongshore. [4-43-38b, 39, 40a]

"Everywhere that province shines forth with highly valuable leaves which will be in
the hue of sapphires, with fibrils in the hue of gold, and with amazing thickets of blue costuses
around lakes, which lakes will be surrounding that province with a resplendence similar to sun.
[4-43-40b, 41]

"There the sand dunes of deep flowing rivers are lumped together with incomparable
pearls, highly valuable jewels and gold. [4-43-42]

"That province is with amazing mountains that are replete with every kind of jewel,
golden in hue, splendorous like Ritual-fire, and they are intercalated into the deep flowing
rivers. [4-43-43]

"There the trees will be eternally flowering and fruiting on which birds will be
endlessly squawking. Their yield will be spilling forth meeting every delicacy with a divine smell,
taste and touch. Some other best trees will yield clothing in numerous shapes. [4-43-44, 45a]

"Some of the best trees will be yielding such of those adornments which will be
vying with ornament made with pearls or with lapis gemstones, and suitable both for women and men.
Like that, they can be worn happily in all seasons. Some other best trees will be yielding gemlike
marvellous decorations applicable to noblesse. [4-43-45, 46]

"There are other trees that produce wooden-beds with astonishing upholsteries, and
even garlands that will be attractively heartening, while some other trees will be yielding juices
and foodstuffs that are relevant to highly choicest consumers. [4-43-47]

"The females of Uttara Kuru province will be handsome and youthful and they are rich
by their attributes. There the radiantly bright celestials like gandharva-s, kinnaraa-s, siddha-s,
vidyaadharaa-s will be delighting along with their own females. [4-43-48b, 49]

"All the inhabitants of North Kuru have carried out good deeds in earlier births,
hence they are accorded with paradisiacal pleasures now. All are engaged in passion, all of them
live in pleasure and prosperity along with their youthful females. [4-43-50]

"The notes of vocal and instrumental music will be flowing out mixed with the peals
of vivacious laughter, which will always come to ears in a heart-stealing manner for all beings.
[4-43-51]

"There is none who is infelicitous and there is none who is friendly to untruthful
ones, and in that province these heart-pleasing attributes of those blessed souls like rejoicing,
festivity etc. will be enriching day by day. [4-43-52]

"On passing beyond that mountain in Uttara Kuru, there is a treasure trove of
waters, namely vast of Northern Ocean, in the mid of which there is gigantic golden mountain named
Mt. Soma. [4-43-53]

"Those who have gone to the sphere of Indra, and those who have gone to the sphere
of Brahma can clearly see that lordly Mt. Soma, situated in the vast of ocean from the vast of
heavens. [4-43-54]

"Even though that place is sunless it is comprehensible as if with sunshine, since
it is illuminated with the resplendence of Mt. Soma itself, which will be irradiating that place as
if with the resplendence of the Sun. [4-43-55]

"The God and Cosmic-Souled Vishnu and Shambhu or Shiva, an embodiment of eleven
selfsame Souls, called <font color="#B3003A">ekaadasha rudra-s</font> , and the god of gods Brahma
who is surrounded by Brahma-Sages, will be sojourning on that Mt. Soma. [4-43-56]

"Under any circumstances you shall not go to the north of Kuru province as there is
no other way out to follow, even for other beings like <font color="#B3003A">daitya, daanava,
yaksha, gandharva</font>-s, though they possess some extraordinary capabilities. [4-43-57]

"That mountain named Soma is an impassable one even for gods, and it will be apt of
you to quickly return from there on seeing that mountain. [4-43-58]

" It is possible for the vanara-s to go only up to there, oh, best vanara-s, and we
have no knowledge of those sunless and boundless realms available far and beyond. [4-43-59]

"You shall thoroughly search in all those provinces that are explained by me, and
you have to make up your mind for searching in other places that are not referred by me.
[4-43-60]

"Thereby, oh, Air-godlike and Wind-godlike vanara-s, on your seeing the princess
born in Videha kingdom, namely Vaidehi, an extremely desirable task for the sake of Dasharatha's
son Rama is considered as done. Thereby it becomes a still privileged accomplishment even for me
achieved through your efforts. [4-43-61]

"Thereafter, oh, fly-jumpers, when you with accomplished purpose and adored by me
with heart-pleasing concessions, and when your enemies are silenced, you will rove over the earth
with your friends and relatives and with your beloveds, also fostering your progeny." Thus Sugreeva
said to the monkeys going to North. [4-43-62]

This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Aranya Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. Here Sugreeva 
is indulged in bodily pleasures with his own females and in Aranya Kanda, as accused by Shurpanakha, Ravana is 
hankering after other's women. Here Sugreeva dizzy with drinks and in Aranya Ravana is dizzy with his supremacy. 
These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with <em>raaja niiti shastra</em> 
'political science.' Here the only rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, 
whereas Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shurpanakha. Out of total 66 verses that are here in 
this traditional edition, verses from 25 to 62 are unavailable in critical edition, perhaps estimating them to 
be lateral interpolations, and there this chapter is quickly concluded. These verses belong to the exposition 
of 'kingly vices...' on which Tara rationally defends.

Then on invitation to inside, Lakshmana, the slayer of braving enemies, entered that delightful cavelike Kishkindha 
at Rama's orders. [4-33-1]

On seeing Lakshmana the huge bodied and highly mighty monkeys available at the gateway stood back with their palms 
adjoined in supplication. [4-33-2]

But on seeing at the fumingly infuriated son of Dasharatha, all the monkeys have become scared and they did not 
even gather around him. [4-33-3]

Glorious Lakshmana has seen the splendid Kishkindha which is a colossal cave crafted with jewels, replete with 
flowered orchards and richly rife with gemlike-objects d'art. [4-33-4]

Kishkindha is compacted with mansions and multi-storied buildings that are embellished with various precious stones, 
and it is enlivened with blossomed trees that bear fruit of every relish and of every season, and Lakshmana has 
seen such a Kishkindha. [4-33-5]

That city is brightened with vanara-s who with their prepossessing appearances are attired in marvellous garlands 
and garments, and who can change their guise just by their wish, as they are the children of gods and gandharva-s, 
and Lakshmana has seen such a city. [4-33-6]

She is perfumed with the fragrances that are pleasing the sense of smell like sandal-scent, true-aloe-scent, and 
the scents of lotuses, and her wide avenues are highly exhilarated with the bouquet of flower-liquors and grape-wines, 
and Lakshmana has seen such a sweet-scanted city Kishkindha. [4-33-7]

In that city Lakshmana of Raghava dynasty has seen buildings that are not single-storied but multi-storied, semblable 
with Mt. Vindhya and Mt. Meru, and he even saw mountain-rapids with pure water. [4-33-8]

On the kings-way Lakshmana has seen the exquisite mansion of Angada, likewise the lavish mansions of distinction 
pertaining to the other vanara chiefs, namely Dvivida, Gavaya, Gavaaksha, Gaja, and Sharabha, Vidyunmaali, Sampaati, 
Suuryaaksha, Hanuma, and that of the noble-souled Nala, and even those of Virabaahu, Subaahu, Kumuda, Sushena, 
Lt. Taara, Jambavanta, Dadhivaktra, Niila, Supaatala, and that of Sunetra. [4-33-9, 10, 11, 12]

Those mansions that glitter like silver-clouds, fragrant with scents and festooned with flower-tassels, replete 
with wealth and food grains, are beaming with gemlike female-vanara-s, and Lakshmana saw them on his way. [4-33-13]

The grand palace of the king of monkeys, Sugreeva, which vies with the palace of Indra is inaccessibly immured 
in a whitely mountain. The spires of that palace are similar to the peaks of Mt. Kailash and it is shining forth 
with fully blossomed trees yielding fruits that can fulfil every relish of everyone. Some more providential and 
heart-pleasing trees available there are the endowment of Indra, which in shine are equal to blackish rainy-clouds, 
yielding divine flowers and fruits, and casting cool shades. Excellent garlands are strung round the palace and 
robust monkeys wielding weapons are screening its gateways, while its main archway cast in refined golden is splendorous. 
And the very bold Lakshmana unimpededly entered such a fascinating palace of Sugreeva, as with the sun entering 
a colossal cloud. [4-33-14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

Passing through a set of seven courtyards in which carriers like palanquins, sedans, and even settees are spread 
over, that duty-bound Lakshmana has seen the highly protected and prodigious palace-chambers of Sugreeva, which 
is stuffed here and there with numerous golden and silver love-beds and divans on which highly valuable upholstery 
is provided. [4-33-19, 20]

On his very entry Lakshmana heard the ongoing melodious tunes commixed with lyrics and strains of string-instruments, 
and all are unvarying in cadence, wording and lettering.

On his very entry Lakshmana heard the ongoing melodious tunes of lyrics with pulsing wording and lettering, conjoined 
with strains from string-instruments, like Veena etc., and all have a pulsating cadency. [4-33-21]

And the great-mighty Lakshmana has seen many females in Sugreeva's palace with diverse features and prideful of 
their beauty and youth. [4-33-22]

On observing the females of a worthy bloodline in the palace of Sugreeva, who are wearing garlands of worthily 
flowers, engrossed in making worthwhile flower-tassels and even adorned with worthiest jewellery, he also made 
a mark of the chambermaids. None of them is overawed, overstrained, and everyone is over-embellished in dressiness. 
[4-33-23, 24]

Thereafter on hearing the chimes of silver-anklets and tintinnabulations of golden cinctures of female vanara-s 
that refulgent Saumitri is embarrassed to proceed further. [4-33-25]

On hearing the tinkles of the jewellery of female vanara-s valiant Lakshmana is highly provoked with an instantaneous 
bitterness, and he twitched bowstring as though to fill all the points of compass with twanging. [4-33-26]

His decent conduct hauling him down dextrous Lakshmana stood aside contingent on isolation, and alongside his 
heartfelt anguish of Rama. [4-33-27]

With that twang of the bowstring the king of fly-jumpers Sugreeva is startled and jerked up from his exquisite 
seat as he ensured that Lakshmana has arrived. [4-33-28]

"As Angada indicated to me earlier, Saumitri, the votary of his brother, has come down on... it is very clear..." 
Thus Sugreeva exclaimed. [4-33-29]

As has been apprised by Angada earlier, and even now by the twang of bowstring, that vanara Sugreeva made up his 
mind about Lakshmana's arrival, and he has become whey-faced. [4-33-30]

The chief of monkeys Sugreeva then staidly spoke this advantageous word to the exquisite lady Tara while his heart 
is bewildered with dismay. [4-33-31]

"This brother of Raghava is mellow-hearted by his nature, oh, suavely eye-browed Tara, but he turned up as if 
with some disdain, really what must be the reason for a grudge! [4-33-32]

"What do you see as the basis of this young man's spite, oh impeccable Tara, this best one among men will not 
invoke despite, indeed, to a fault. [4-33-33]

"If you consider that we have done something objectionable to him, in the least, let that be quickly determined 
by your nimble-wittedness and let that be made known immediately. [4-33-34]

"Otherwise, oh, lady, you alone are apt to see him in person, and it will be apt of you to appease him with words 
blent with mitigation. [4-33-35]

"Just on seeing you he that highly pure-souled Lakshmana will stop venting his spleen, by the way, great-souls 
will not be rampageous with women, isn't it! [4-33-36]

"If you seek his presence with propitiatory words his heart and senses will be pacified, and then I will be able 
to see that lotus-petal-eyed Lakshmana, the destroyer of his enemies." Sugreeva thus spoke to Tara. [4-33-37]

Exquisitely featured Tara went to the proximity of Lakshmana with a waddling gait, tipsily flustering eyes, rrivière-strings 
of golden cincture dangling, and with a sticklike gracile body humbly bent. [4-33-38]

On observing the wife of the king of monkeys, the great-souled son of the king of humans stood aside unemotionally, 
and because of the presence of females he backed down on his anger with his face cast down. [4-33-39]

She who is unblushing by virtue of her inebriety ad even by the gracious look of the prince Lakshmana, such a 
Tara spoke a highly noteworthy sentence that is dauntless in friendliness and entirely mitigatory in its vein. 
[4-33-40]

"Oh, prince, what is the cause of your anger? Who is not abiding by your oral order? And who is he that draweth 
nigh of a wildfire that is befalling on a forest of dried-up trees, without a shadow of doubt?" Tara enquired 
thus with Lakshmana. [4-33-41]

On hearing her words which are with a prelude of propitiation, and which by far evince friendship for all practical 
purposes, Lakshmana trustfully spoke these words. [4-33-42]

"Oh, Tara, the associate of husband's prosperity! Why your husband is bound up in profligacy alone, remiss in 
garnering rectitude and riches, and his dereliction is unbeknownst to you, is it! [4-33-43]

"Without thinking either about the interests of the kingdom or about us that are cringing to anguish, oh, Tara, 
your husband along with his council of ministers is indulged in lechery. [4-33-44]

"On stipulating a four month criterion for an embargo the king of fly-jumpers is not able to realise the completion 
of that period as he is frantically insensible. [4-33-45]

"For the purpose of achieving rightly rectitude and rightful riches this way of bacchanalia is inappreciable, 
isn't it! Just going on drinking will bring prosperity, aspirations and even probity to ruin. [4-33-46]

"If one is not going to requite the favour done in his respect an awful detriment occurs in his own rectitude, 
isn't it. Thereby, that reneger will loose a highly noble friend and thereby a great shortcoming occurs to him 
in achieving his purposes. Thus a threefold ill befalls on that reneger. [4-33-47]

"Indeed a friend avowed to truthfulness and virtuousness is greater than one's own means and aspirations, but 
you husband forsaking that pair of his means and aspirations that have been fulfilled by such a righteous friend, 
he is not even standing by the probity. [4-33-48]

"Therefore, when our present task is standstill in this way due to the bouts of your husband, oh, the knower of 
the brunt of tasks, what is it we can undertake hereafter...you yourself may aptly give an example..." Thus, Lakshmana 
spoke curtly to Tara. [4-33-49]

On hearing his words containing means, merit and reconciliation, and of mellowly tendency of Lakshmana, Tara realized 
that the purpose of Rama is lapsed, but having confidence in ultimate success she again said to him.

On hearing his words containing means, merit and reconciliation, and of mellowly tendency of Lakshmana, and even 
on realizing the lapse committed by Sugreeva in the purpose of Rama, yet reposing her confidence in Sugreeva's 
capability to achieve results, she again said to Lakshmana.&nbsp; [4-33-50]

"Oh, prince, this not the time for angering, also your own people shall not be subjected to anger, and it will 
be apt of you to tolerate Sugreeva's fault because he is desirous of achieving results for you. [4-33-51]

How in name can a meritoriously high-minded being will show his anger on a relatively mightless inferior being, 
say Sugreeva, whose mightiest brother's mightiness and essence, say that of Vali, are deducted by none other but 
by your brother associated with you, and oh, lad, who goes into the control of fury, say of your kind, while he 
is restrained by his perfection, and a source of abstemiousness. [4-33-52]

"I am aware of the fury of Rama, the friend of champion of the monkeys, namely Sugreeva, I am also aware of the 
time lapse in the task, I am even aware of the folly we have committed, and what need be done in this matter, 
I am well aware. [4-33-53]

"As to how the intensity of bodily pleasure-seeking will be highly intolerable, I am aware even of that, and I 
am equally aware of those female vanara-s with whom Sugreeva is now incessantly bound up with lust. [4-33-54]

"Gauging by your mindset which is presently bridled by fury, you appear to be disinclined towards spells of sensualities, 
thus these aspects are past your comprehension. All right! If a man were to be voluptuary he will be inadvertent 
of place and time, isn't it! Then, how about ethicalities, or rights and wrongs? [4-33-55]

"He who shunned decency because of the vehemence of randiness, oh, the eradicator of braving enemies, and he who 
is delighting in lust is consorted with me, ergo condone your brother-like Sugreeva, the protector of Vaanara 
dynasty. [4-33-56]

"Esteemed sages who take delight in their holy merit and pious asceticism, they themselves will be closely following 
the course of their desire fulfilment when entangled in lust, then how about this one, namely Sugreeva, being 
an impulsive monkey, besides being a king, how he cannot wallow in enjoyments. [4-33-57]

She that vanara female Tara whose eyes are fluttery under the influence having said this way, she again picked 
up where she left off and sentimentally spoke this sentence to Lakshmana whose brunt is inestimable, in the interest 
of her husband's wellbeing. [4-33-58]

"On the part of his endeavour in your task, oh, best one among men, he has ordered long before for its operation 
aiming to achieve your objective, despite of the fact that he is servile to overindulgence. [4-33-59]

"By all means, marvellously intrepid Vanara-s that are the residents of various mountains and that can change 
gusie just by their wish have come in hundreds, in thousands, in millions. [4-33-60]

"Hence oh, dextrous one, get inside the palace-chambers for you have been standing here at the door coyly unwilling 
to behold womenfolk inside, and enough is this upholding of tradition by you. Oh, come on, peering at the wives 
of friends with a friendly intent is not at all impolite for good-willers." Thus Tara affectionately invited Lakshmana 
inside the palace-chambers. [4-33-61]

Welcomed by Tara and hastened by haste of his duty, that dextrous enemy-destroyer Lakshmana entered the select-chambers. 
[4-33-62]

Lakshmana has then seen him who is seated like the Sun in firmament on a choicest golden seat which is elaborated 
with worthiest upholstery, whose body is remarkable besides being spruced up with excellent ornaments, who is 
wearing exquisite garlands and robes, who is glorious with a marvellous appearance and even appeared as an unconquerable 
as with Indra, and who is presently enwreathed with vanara-females who are also bedecked with precious ornamentation 
and garlands, and on seeing him Lakshmana with franticly bloodshot eyes appeared as the Terminator. [4-33-63, 
64, 65]

Sugreeva whose complexion is like that of rich gold is seated on an exquisite seat tightly hugging his wife Ruma, 
and that brave one has seen Lakshmana whose quintessence is never-flinching, thus, that suspiciously wide-eyed 
Sugreeva made sheep eyes at the furiously broad-eyed Lakshmana. [4-33-66]

Rama spoke to Lakshmana while residing on the mountainside of Mt. Malayavata, also known as Mt. Prasavana, ensuing 
the elimination of Vali and enthronement of Sugreeva. [3-28-1]

"This is that time of which we thought and it has come to pass. Now it is rainy season. You see the sky fully 
covered with mountainous clouds. [3-28-2]

"Sustaining a nine-month pregnancy, impregnated through the Sun with his sunrays guzzling the essence of oceans, 
the heaven is giving birth to the elixir of life. [3-28-3]

"It is very likely to climb up the flight of stairs of clouds to bedeck the sun with the garlands of white wild-jasmines, 
and red Arjuna flowers, in these days. [3-28-4]

"Those clouds with pure white edges, and with reddish hue of sunset extending on them, look like soft pieces of 
cloth bandaged on the gashes of sky. [3-28-5]

"Slothful breezes as her sighs, sunset tingeing her as sandal paste, the sky with blanched clouds on her face 
appears like the one sighing for love. [3-28-6]

"Overly agonised with the searing-summer, but thoroughly wetted with new waters, this earth looks like Seetha, 
both implacably outpouring tears. [3-28-7]

"Freed from the wombs of clouds, cool as the leaves of minty-camphor, perfumed with the fragrance of Mogra plants, 
such as these breezes are it is possible to have a draught of them with the bowl of palms. [3-28-8]

"This mountain with fully bloomed Arjuna flowers, further fragranced by Ketaka flowers is being anointed with 
downpours on a par with Sugreeva, who is anointed when his enemy is silenced. [3-28-9]

"Donning clouds as black deer skins, torrents as sacred-threads, and caves replete with breezes as vocals, the 
mountains look like young-scholars reciting Veda-s. [3-28-10]

"While the flashes of lightning are whipping the sky as if they are the golden whips, it is letting out rattle 
of thunders holding out against its inly throes. [3-28-11]

"That lightning hingeing on the blue cloud is squirmy, to me it appears like woeful Vaidehi squirming in the grasp 
of Ravana. [3-28-12]

"For those who are with their beloveds these precincts are advantageous, as their directions, as to which east 
and which is west, are unclear; and to loverless ones like me they are disadvantageous, because the same precincts 
have their planets and even their moon lost, and they look as though begrimed with dark-clouds. [3-28-13]

"Feeling happy with the arrival of rain wild jasmine plants standing somewhere on the terraces of mountain are 
flowered, and they are thickly covered with droplets of vapour, as if they are the tears of happiness hovering 
round the flower like faces of ladyloves at the arrival of their lovers, and such plants are becoming inciters 
of passion in me, who am let down by my sorrow for my ladylove. [3-28-14]

"In these days the dust is quietened, breeze is chilly, vile pervasions of summer are also quietened, conquests 
of kings indeed came to a halt, and the people in outstation are returning to their own countries. [3-28-15]

"Presently swans have started journey to Lake Manasa eager to live there, but the Cakravaka birds, ruddy gees, 
that are together with their beloveds are not departing, and vehicles are not taking to road as the rainwater 
has battered the roadways oftentimes. [3-28-16]

"Widely bestrewn with clouds the sky is bright somewhere, and not so bright somewhere else, thus it is gleaming 
well with an aspect of vast but tideless ocean that is by far dammed up with cloudlike mountains. [3-28-17]

"Coalesced with Sarja and Wild-jasmine flowers, and also with the coppery ores of the mountain, the new waters 
are swiftly transiting towards ocean, while screams of peacocks haunting them. [3-28-18]

"The fruits of rose-apple that resemble honeybees are delightedly devoured as they are highly luscious, but the 
mango fruits that are discoloured and putrefied are falling to ground heaved down by wind. [3-28-19]

"Electric-charges as their fluttering flags of war, flights of cranes as their garlands of gallantry, those clouds 
very similar in their build to the pinnacles of lordly mountains are thundering with very high pitched voices 
like invigorated lordly elephants standing up to a fight. [3-28-20]

"When clouds have completely rained on the greenery pasturelands are satiated with rainwater and peacocks are 
stimulated to dancing carnivals, thus it is extremely splendorous in afternoons, behold it. [3-28-21]

"Clouds adorned with cranes around them are rumbling to transport them, and the weighty water contained inside 
their wombs, and reposing on the loftiest mountain peaks they are moving, moving and again reposing, like pregnant 
women. [3-28-22]

"Highly delighted cranes are flying all over in rows highly desirous of the clouds, and they are shining forth 
like the best and lovely festoons of white lotus flowers as if wind has upheaved and dangled them on the sky. 
[3-28-23]

"The meadowland is with its new meadows which are medially dappled with young and small red-beetles, and it is 
shining forth as if she is a woman wearing a parrot-green wraparound on which lac-red spots are embroidered. [3-28-24]

"These days sleep is slowly getting closer to Vishnu, rivers are rapidly getting closer to oceans, cranes are 
gleefully getting closer to clouds, and women are passionately getting closer to their beloveds. [3-28-25]

"Interiors of forests have become adaptive for the peacocks to dance very well, Kadamba trees have become adaptive 
to their branches and bouquets, bulls with matching sensualities became adaptive to cows, and adaptive is this 
earth with its enrapturing crops and orchards, and all are adaptive to the season's gaiety. [3-28-26]

"Rivers are surging, clouds are showering, rutty elephants are shrilling, forest interiors are shining, loverless 
are speculating, and peacocks are rocking, monkeys are resolving to stay at one place, for this is the rainy season. 
[3-28-27]

"On whiffing the fragrance of new Ketaka flowers the lordly elephants are highly joyous and became excited, but 
they are baffled at the sounds made by the fall of water in the streamlets of forest, and those best ruttish elephants 
are blaring along with screaming peacocks. [3-28-28]

"Honeybees languishing on the branches of Kadamba trees are knocked down by the downpour of rain, thereby they 
are slowly forfeiting the intemperance which they acquired in a trice by plunging themselves into the nectar of 
flowers. [3-28-29]

"Rose-apple trees contain abundant fruits with profuse juice which look like the globated coal powder, with them 
the branches of those trees shine forth as though swilled by hives of honeybees. [3-28-30]

"Ornamented with the flags of lightning, and that have whooping, profound and blaring booms, those clouds by their 
appearances are verily shining forth like the elephants enthusiastic for a war. [3-28-31]

"That energetic and lordly elephant which readily started going towards the forest minding the track of that mountain, 
heard the thundering of the cloud, and doubting it a the war-whoop of another elephant took a right about turn 
wishing for a head-on collision with it. [3-28-32]

"Somewhere the interiors of forests are finely singing, in affect, as they have swarms of singing honeybees; elsewhere, 
they are richly dancing, practically, as the purple-necked peacocks are bestirring; somewhere else, they are highly 
excited, virtually, as lordly elephants are highly excited, thus the interiors of forests are beaming forth as 
retreats to many bees, birds and animals. [3-28-33]

"Plentiful in Kadamba, Sarja, Arjuna, Kandala trees and with the heaps of their reddish flowers fallen on ground, 
and well-excited peacocks screaming and dancing like the tipplers of that liquor like nectar, thus the interiors 
of forest are aplenty with nectar of those fallen flowers flowing like water, thus they are impressively similar 
to the lands of liquor, say watering-holes. [3-28-34]

"Extremely clear, pure, pearl-similar rainwater given as a gift by Indra is falling down and clinching the hallows 
of leaves, such as it is, it is heartily guzzled down by the thirsty birds whose wings are discoloured by the 
same water. [3-28-35]

"Melodious string bass of honeybees as stringendo, frogs crocking as vocal rhythm, fortissimos of clouds as drumbeats, 
music has commenced in the forest as though programmed. [3-28-36]

"Somewhere dancing well, elsewhere voicing in high pitch, and somewhere else seated high on the trees are the 
peacocks with plumaged tails as their dangling decorations, and it appears as the music and dance have commenced 
in the forests as programmed. [3-28-37]

"Thunders of clouds called up the frogs, and casting off their long-time captivity in sleep, frogs of various 
casts, carves, colours and crocks are crocking scourged heavily by the streams of new waters. [3-28-38]

"Prideful rivers are swiftly surging near and near of their lover-like ocean overflowing their own battered riverbanks, 
and in doing so they are swinging and seesawing flights of ruddy gees flying on their bosom, where the curvatures 
of bird-flight look like the new, full-fledged, seducible, nubile breasts of the river, and in doing so the river 
is also lugging other items of romance, namely flowers and fruits, steeped in their new waters. [3-28-39]

"When the swarthy clouds full with new waters are docking among swarthily clouds, they are shining forth like 
mountains burnt by wildfire docking among other mountains that are already burnt by wildfire, both moored at mountain-bases. 
[3-28-40]

"Elephants are moving about the very pleasant interiors of forests where peahens are voluptuously screaming, pasturelands 
are overspread with red-beetles, and where they are fragranced with the flowers of Niipa and Arjuna trees. [3-28-41]

"Lashed are the fibrils of lotuses with the downpour of new waters, hence quickly leaving them off the joyful 
honeybees are quaffing the Kadamba flowers with new fibrils. [3-28-42]

"In forests lordly elephants are ruttish, ideal bulls that are delighted, peerless lions are triumphant to a better 
degree, lofty mountains are heart-pleasant, lords of people are withdrawing from their campaigns, and the lord 
of gods, Indra, is playing well with water giving clouds. [3-28-43]

"The clouds having torrential water are soaring the sky, and spurning the booms of oceans with their rumbles they 
are inundating rivers, lakes, pools, tanks and even the earth. [3-28-44]

"Rains are falling substantially and speedily, gales are blowing intensified in their speediness, while rivers 
are conducting water speedily over their eroded riverbanks and far afield of their course. [3-28-45]

"Lords of people will be anointed by people with water carried in pots on their shoulders, and then those kings 
show their propitious aspect of a humanly king with applied divinity, whereas the lords of mountains are being 
anointed with the water sent directly by Indra and hitherto wafted straight by Air-god in the pots called black-clouds, 
thus these lordly mountains are standing alone as if showing their grandeur and divinity on earth. [3-28-46]

"Sky is closely enshrouded with clouds, neither sun nor stars are getting around for a glimpse, earth is fully 
satiated with the torrents of new water, enswathed in obscurity the precincts are unilluminated... [3-28-47]

"The paramount pinnacles of the mountains are thoroughly washed by the torrential rains and are shining forth 
surpassingly, and the voluminous and widespread torrents that are pitching down are like the pearly necklaces 
pendulous on the chests of mountains. [3-28-48]

"Washing the mountain stones speedily the torrents on the lofty mountains are widespread and entering the caves, 
in which peacocks are highly screaming, and thus they are in the gleam of lavalieres strewn around. [3-28-49]

"On neatly washing the crests of wide mountains and their nearby planes, the high-speeded waterfalls are falling 
like pearl-necklaces and the mountains are wearing them at the planes of their cavernous caves. [3-28-50]

"Like the strings of pearls of heavenly females plopping down when broken in the friction of lovemaking, excellent 
streams of water are falling all over and in all directions. [3-28-51]

"With the return of birds to nests, doubling up of lotuses, and blooming up jasmines, the sun is know to have 
gone into dusk. [3-28-52]

"Reversed are the campaigns of kings as the armies are marooned and thus rainwater has neutralised conflicts and 
roadways. [3-28-53]

"The month of Bhaadrapada, August-September, is the time for learning the singing of Sama Veda, and this is the 
time that has come for those Brahmans who concern themselves for learning the singing of Sama Veda. [3-28-54]

"On carrying out all the domestic affairs and completely garnering the goods for rainy season, Bharata, the king 
of Kosala, might have definitely undertaken the 'four-month-vow' on the full moon day of aSaaDha month. [3-28-55]

"Definitely the River Sarayu must be overfilling and its swashing must be mounting as with the commotion of Ayodhya 
on beholding my returning to city. [3-28-56]

"This rainy season as such has manifold inbuilt facilities for self-contained entertainment, so Sugreeva must 
be luxuriating in them, besides, revelling for conquering his enemy, regaining his wife, and instituting himself 
as a king of an admirable kingdom. [3-28-57]

"As for me, Lakshmana, I am the one who is toppled from a great kingdom, whose wife is stolen, such as I am, I 
am toppling down like a riverbank that is toppled over. [3-28-58]

"Also my anguish is boundless, the rains have definitely made the pathways impassable, my enemy Ravana is a formidable 
one, thus these three appear to me as insurmountable obstacles. [3-28-59]

"Though Sugreeva is very humble to embark on a campaign, visualising the rainy season as an impossible one for 
any campaign, and even the pathways are rendered highly impassable I have not said anything to him in the affirmative. 
[3-28-60]

"Even Sugreeva has undergone many difficulties in their entirety, after a long while he is united with his wife, 
and even owing to the magnitude involved in our task of tracking down Ravana I did not desire to insist on that 
monkey. [3-28-61]

"After a respite Sugreeva will realise on his own that the time has come, and he will also realise the he has 
something to requite, isn't it! So, there needn't be any doubt in that matter. [3-28-62]

"I therefore stay abidingly looking forward for the time, oh, Lakshmana with felicitous aspects, expectant of 
the generosity of Sugreeva and of these rivers. [3-28-63]

"A valiant one who is succoured will be indebted with some requital on his part, but besides being unfaithful, 
if one who does not make requital for all the favours done in his interest, he will be wounding the hearts of 
soft-hearted people." Rama said so to Lakshmana, keeping Sugreeva in view. [3-28-64]

Visualising what Rama said about their waiting for pre-winter season to be candid, and praisefully making palm-fold 
at that determination of Rama, and even to clarify his own opportune viewpoint, Lakshmana spoke to Rama who by 
his own aspect is a delightful one for a ken. [3-28-65]

"Oh, lord of people, Sugreeva will be effectuating everything you have desired and said, not later but soon, hence 
awaiting autumn you may please bear up these heavy rainfalls, besides bearing with the idea of disciplining the 
enemy." So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-28-66]

Sugreeva started to adore and extol Raghava on hearing the words of Rama that are
inculcating happiness and pride. [4-11-1]

"It is doubtless that you will burn down everything when you are angry, like the
blazing sun at the end of era, with these arrows of yours that are highly blazing, incisive and
invaders on stealthy places." Thus Sugreeva started extolling Rama. [4-11-2]

"That which is impetuousness of Vali, that which is his bravery and courageousness
are there, they may be listened from me single-mindedly, and later you impose that which need be
imposed. [4-11-3]

"Before the dawn of sun Vali unweariedly strides from western ocean to eastern, and
even from southern to northern for offering water oblations to the rising sun. [4-11-4]

"Ascending the heights of mountains and even rending their greatest peaks, that
mighty one volleys them upwards and in turn catches them, as though they are play balls.
[4-11-5]

"As a show his strength Vali used to personally fell many sturdy trees of diverse
origin by his might. [4-11-6]

"One named Dundubhi was there in the form of a buffalo, whose size shone forth like
Mt. Kailash and who bears the strength of a thousand elephants." Thus Sugreeva started telling
Dundubhi's episode to Rama. [4-11-7]

"He that evil-minded and colossal bodied Dundubhi was bemused by the vanity of his
own vigour, and by the boon bestowed oo him, and once he went to the lord of rivers, namely the
Ocean. [4-11-8]

"Deriding the garner of weaves and gems he said to that vastly ocean "give me a
fight" [4-11-9]

"Then, oh, Rama, that virtue-minded and very powerful ocean rose up from his tabular
position to heights, and spoke these words to that demon Dundubhi who is driven to doom by his own
time. [4-11-10]

"I am not capable to give you a fight, oh, war-expert, but I will name him who can
give you a fight, listen." So said ocean to the demon. [4-11-11]

"A sublime shelter for sages and the father-in-law of Shankara is there in great
forests, well-know by the name Himavan, the king of mountains, and he embodies great cascades,
cataracts, and caves, and he alone is capable to accord a matchless happiness to you in the form of
a fight." So said ocean to Dundubhi. [4-11-12, 13]

"Fathoming that ocean to be scared of him that noted demon Dundubhi arrived at the
forests of Himavan like an arrow darted from bow, and that Dundubhi started to blare discordantly
and toss the rock-faces of that mountain that are like white elephants in their figuration,
severally. [4-11-14, 15]

"Then he who is like a silver cloud in his figuration, a gentle and delightful one
in his appearance, that Himavan spoke these words to the demon staying on his own cliff.
[4-11-16]

"It is inapt of you to annoy me, oh, virtuous Dundubhi, I am just a shelterer of
sages, and an unskilled one in fights." So said Himavan to Dundubhi. [4-11-17]

"On hearing the words of that modest king of mountains Dundubhi's uyes are bloodshot
and he said this sentence. [4-11-18]

"Whether you are incapable to fight with me, or not venturing me as you are scared
of me is not my concern, but tell me who can really give me a very combative fight,. [4-11-19]

On hearing Dundubhi's arrogant words that honest Himavan being an expert in
sentence-making, had to say angry words to that fierce demon that were never uttered by him
earlier. [4-11-20]

"Oh, war-expert Dundubhi, Indra's son is there, a brave and glorious one by name
Vali, and he is now presiding over the matchlessly pompous city Kishkindha. [4-11-21]

"He is a highly intelligent one and a war-expert too, and he is the capable one to
give you a duel, like Indra to Namuchi. [4-11-22]

"Approach him promptly if you desire a fight now, and he is an intrepid one who will
always be in the manoeuvres of war, and indeed none can assail him." Thus said Himavan to that
demon Dundubhi. [4-11-23]

"Then on hearing Himavan's words he that Dundubhi is convulsed in anger and
proceeded to Vali's city Kishkindha.. [4-11-24]

"That great mighty demon Dundubhi wearing the look of a buffalo with sharp horns was
awe-inspiring, and like the arrival of a massive dark cloud in rainy season full with water on the
edge of firmament, he arrived at the gateway of Kishkindha and bellowed clamorously like a war-drum
as though to quake the earth. [4-11-25, 26]

"He bellowed uprooting trees that are rooted nearby, scooping the earth with hooves,
and insolently goring the gateway with horns like a goring elephant. [4-11-27]

"Vali who by then went into his palace chambers became intolerant to hear that noise
and fell out from there along with ladies, like the moon with stars. [4-11-28]

"Vali being the lord of monkeys, and of all the other forest-dwellers as well, spoke
a clearly worded brief sentence to Dundubhi. [4-11-29]

"Oh, Dundubhi, impeding the gateway of this city what for you are bellowing, I know
you, oh, might one, save your lives." Vali cautioned that demon that way. [4-11-30]

"On hearing that sentence of Vali, the tactful lord of monkeys, Dundubhi said this
sentence with his eyes bloodshot in anger." Thus Sugreeva continued his narration to Rama.
[4-11-31]

"It is inapt of you to speak words in the vicinity of ladies, oh, valiant Vali, give
me a duel now and then I can appreciate your might." [4-11-32]

"Otherwise I bear up my rage for this night, oh, monkey, you may unrestrainedly
delight yourself till morning in your voluptuous gratifications, for you are now surrounded by your
ladies." [4-11-33]

"Also embrace all the monkeys and bequeath endowments to them, and you may bid adieu
to all the good-hearted people of yours for you are the king of all the tree-branch animals, as you
may not see them later. [4-11-34]

"Let Kishkindha city be seen clearly by you as last sight, and keep someone
equalling you as in charge of city, and also rejoice with the females till sunrise as there is no
tomorrow to you. [4-11-35]

"He who kills a drunken one, unvigilant one, defeated one, or one without weapons,
or an atrophied one, he get the sin of foeticide in the world, and your present state is suchlike."
Dundubhi incited Vali in this way. [4-11-36]

"Then Vali laughed that demon off, discharged all the females namely Tara and
others, and then he spoke to that stupid lord of demons in anger. [4-11-37]

"Don't surmise that I am drunk, and should you be unafraid of a fight, regard this
drunkenness of mine as the toast of a gallant fighter in this deadly fight." Vali said so to
Dundubhi. [4-11-38]

"Saying that way to that Dundubhi that highly enraged Vali heaved up the golden
chest-pendant around his neck on to his chest, which was given by his father Mahendra, and stood
firm for fight. [4-11-39]

"Then that elephantine monkey Vali took that mountain-similar Dundubhi by horns, and
booming highly he whirled and bumped him onto ground. [4-11-40]

"Vali while blaring highly with great sound repeatedly whirled him and thrown onto
ground, and while Dundubhi was hurled and thrown to ground, blood gushed out of his two ears.
[4-11-41]

"There occurred a gruesome fight among those two, Dundubhi and Vali, who by their
fury are impetuous and who aspired victory over the other. [4-11-42]

"Then Vali who is similar to Indra in his fortitude fought with him with his fists,
knees and feet, and like that with boulders and trees. [4-11-43]

"While each is assaulting the other in that fight between that monkey and demon,
that demon is impaired and Indra's son Vali toughened. [4-11-44]

"In that life-taking fight when Dundubhi is lifted up and flung to ground, he is
completely pounded out. [4-11-45]

"While he is felled down much blood is flown out from the vent-holes of his body,
nine of them, ears, nose, eyes etc., and on his falling that mighty one Dundubhi attained the
fifth-state. [4-11-46]

"Then the hastiest Vali swayed that dead and inanimate demon with both of his hands
and hurled him a yojana distance in a single flick. [4-11-47]

"And while he is thrown that hastily blood drops oozed from his mouth, and flung by
air they fell in the hermitage of sage Matanga. [4-11-48]

"On seeing the blood drops fallen there, oh Rama, that sage is enraged and thought,
'who is he indeed, who dropped the blood...' Thus Sugreeva narrated to Rama. [4-11-49]

" 'By which evil-spirited one I am abruptly touched with blood? Who is that
evil-minded one? Who is that malevolent, disobedient and a reckless one?' Thus the sage Matanga
pondered. [4-11-50]

"Thinking thus and coming out of hermitage that celebrated sage has seen the
mountainous buffalo fallen on ground lifelessly. [4-11-51]

"On knowing by his ascetic power that this deed is done by the monkey, he released a
great curse on him who tossed the cadaver of buffalo. [4-11-52]

"Untreadable is this sheltering wood of mine to him who has stained it with squirts
of blood, and if he enters this place peradventure, fatality occurs on him. [4-11-53]

"By his hurling the demon's body these trees are also completely destroyed, hence he
ought not set his foot in a distance of one full yojana around this hermitage, and if that
evil-minded one places his foot then he evidently does not exist. [4-11-54, 55a]

"And some of his friends that are dependent on my woods shall not live here and they
may depart on hearing my words and solace themselves with my words. [4-11-55b, 56a]

"This forest of mine is always protected like my own son, and if the monkeys of Vali
wish to stay behind in this forest alone for further destruction of leaves or sprouts, or even for
the non-existence of fruits and tubers of this forest, defiantly they too will be cursed.
[4-11-57]

"And today is the day of limit and the monkey whom I will see tomorrow, he will be
petrified for many thousand years to come. [4-11-58]

"Then those monkeys on hearing the clear wording of the sage started out from that
forest, and on their coming to Kishkindha, Vali saw them and spoke this way to them. [4-11-59]

" 'Why all of you dwellers of Matanga forest arrived in my presence, even so, are
you the dwellers of that forest safe?' Thus Vali asked all. [4-11-60]

"Then all of those monkeys have reported to Vali, the one with a golden
chest-pendant, all the reasons for their exit, likewise the curse to Vali. [4-11-61]

"Then on hearing all those words narrated by monkeys Vali approached that great sage
and begged of him on becoming humble with palm-fold. [4-11-62]

"The sage inconsiderate of Vali's request withdrew into hermitage, and fearing to
bear the brunt of the curse Vali was distraught and withdrew from that place. [4-11-63]

"Then, dreaded by the fear of curse that monkey Vali does not aspire to enter the
great mountain Rishyamuka, oh, people's lord, Rama, or he does not even wish to look at it." Thus
Sugreeva continued his narration. [4-11-64]

"Knowing the inaccessibility of this forest to him I got rid of my agony, Rama, and
I move here about in this great forest along with my ministers. [4-11-65]

"This huge heap of bones that is shining forth like a mountaintop is that of
Dundubhi, which Vali once hurled by the vanity of his valour. [4-11-66]

"Also these are the seven enormous sala trees full with their branches, and Vali is
capable to make each of them leafless by his vigour, of course, one at a time. [4-11-67]

"Oh, Rama, I am apprising all this to tell about the unequalled vitality of Vali,
and oh, king, then how is it possible for you to eliminate Vali in war." Thus Sugreeva enquired
with Rama. [4-11-68]

When Sugreeva spoke that way Lakshmana a little smiled and asked him, "On performing
which act do you confide in the possibility of Vali's elimination?" [4-11-69]

Then Sugreeva said to Lakshmana, "earlier Vali used to agitate each of the trees,
one after the other, on many occasions." [4-11-70]

"If Rama can rend one tree out of the seven with only one arrow, then on seeing
Rama's valour I can construe that Vali is utterly dead at his hand. [4-11-71]

"Lakshmana, if he lifts and kicks the skeleton of this dead buffalo by the might of
his foot, and makes it fall at a distance of two hundred bow-lengths, I can confide." So said
Sugreeva to Lakshmana. [4-11-72]

Sugreeva paused for a while on saying thus to Rama, for Rama's eye-corners are
reddened with anger towards Vali, and then Sugreeva again spoke to Rama. [4-11-73]

"Vali is a mighty monkey, an intrepid one, who esteems his own intrepidity, and one
who is well renowned by his might and tenacity, and in combats he is an undefeated one.
[4-11-74]

"His deeds that are impracticable even for gods are obvious, and scared for
recollecting them I took shelter of Mt. Rishyamuka. [4-11-75]

"Concluding that the lord of monkeys Vali to be an unconquerable, unattackable,
unsympathetic one I am not leaving this Mt. Rishyamuka. [4-11-76]

"I am moving about these forests along with earnest ministers like Hanuma and other
significant ones, only because I am disconcerted and sceptical of him. [4-11-77]

"I chanced upon a laudable and true friend in you, oh, Rama, the patron of friends,
hence I take shelter in you, oh, tigerly man, for you are the final resort for those seeking
salvation, like Mt. Himavan. [4-11-78]

"I know the might of that mighty brother-the-malice of mine, and oh, Raghava, but
your valour in combat is imprecise to me." [4-11-79]

"Definitely I am neither examining, nor demeaning, nor intimidating you, but his
macabre exploits caused cowardice in me. [4-11-80]

"It is definite, oh, Raghava, your word, courage, and physique denote some sublime
radiance in you, as with ash covered fire." So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-11-81]

On hearing that word of great-souled Sugreeva, Rama smilingly replied that monkey in
his turn. [4-11-82]

"If you are unable to confide in the intrepidity of ours, oh, monkey, I shall
ingrain commendable confidence in you with respect to our action." Thus Rama said to Sugreeva.
[4-11-83]

Saying so to Sugreeva in a comforting manner, he that dextrous, vigorous Rama, the
elder brother of Lakshmana sportively flipped the skeleton of Dundubhi with his big toe, and
flicked that withered body of the demon with his big toe itself to a ten yojana distance without
lifting his foot. [4-11-84, 85]

Then on seeing at the hurled body, and at valiant Rama who by now is like the
blazing sun, again Sugreeva said this meaningful word to Rama in the presence of Lakshmana and
other monkeys. [4-11-86]

"Oh, friend, at that time when my tired and tipsy brother Vali tossed this body it
was unspoilt, wet with blood and full with flesh. [4-11-87]

"Raghava, now this body is sleazy, without flesh, also rendered into a strawy
condition, and oh, Raghu's delight, you too flipped it because you are now energetic. [4-11-88]

"If it be said something is wet or dried up there chances a lot of difference, oh,
Raghava, thereby it may not be possible to assess whether you might is greater or his, as the
gravity of the case depends much on that wetness or dryness alone, isn't it." [4-11-89]

"That alone is the uncertainty in that matter, sire, whether your strength is
superior or his, and if a single sala tree is ripped in an outright manner the ability or otherwise
will be evident. [4-11-90]

"String the bowstring to this bow of yours, an alternate of elephant's trunk, and
stretch it out up to your ear, and release a great arrow. [4-11-91]

"Darted by you your arrow will rip off this sala tree, oh, king, there is no doubt
in that matter, enough is this thinking of yours and you will definitely do me this favour, I pray
and swear upon me." [4-11-92]

"As to how the sun is unsurpassed among all brilliances, as to how Himavan is
unmatched among all mountains, as to how the lion is unequalled among all quadrupeds, so you are
among all men for your unique valour." So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-11-93]

A word about this chapter. Readers acquainted with critical version of Ramayana may
find some 35 verses in this chapter that are unknown to them. They occur in all the other
traditional versions and they carry the blemish of interpolation. They are inescapable in
traditional versions, as age-old commentators have commented on them at length.

On Sugreeva's entering the cave-like Kishkindha, Rama who spent rainy nights on that
mountain with much distress owing to the misery of yearning for Seetha, has seen the immaculate
sphere of moon on silvern sky freed by ceasing rains, and even autumnal nights that are enamelled
with moonshine, and thus he observed that Seetha is lost hopelessly, engrossed in lust Sugreeva is
lost to world intractably, and furthermore time too is being lost irretrievably, and thus he became
highly impatient and even swooned. [4-30-1, 2, 3]

But on getting consciousness in a moment, that thoughtful king Raghava started to
think of Vaidehi who is abiding in his heart, though not at his side. [4-30-4]

On seeing the sky to be spic and span when set free of black-clouds and lightning,
and even vibrant with the shrieks of Saarasa birds, Rama bemoaned in woeful words. [4-30-5]

Rama's concepts are on the rove towards his ladylove when he beheld the skyscape of
autumn while sitting on the summit of a mountain that is embellished with gold and other ores, and
he soliloquised his thoughts in this way. [4-30-6]

"Young Seetha with a voice that is a soundalike to the callings of Saarasa birds
used to take delight in these resonant calls of Saarasa birds when we were together in hermitage,
but how she might be taking delight in these chirrups now without me. [4-30-7]

"On seeing the flawless Asana trees flowered as if with golden flowers, she checks
up for my availability thereabout, but now finding me nowhere near her, how can she be happy.
[4-30-8]

"She who is enchanting to me by her well-proportioned limbs that clucky-voiced
Seetha earlier used to wake me up in tune with the melodious callings of clucking-swans, but how
that ladylove of mine might be amusing herself now. [4-30-9]

"On hearing the sharp notes of Cakravaka birds that always move together in couples,
what will become of this white-lotus-like broad-eyed Seetha, since she is not together with me.
[4-30-10]

"I am not able to enjoy myself without that deer-eyed lady though wandering around
enjoyable lakes, rivers, tanks, forests and woodlands, whose thirst is drenched by rainwater and my
thirsting for her is not. [4-30-11]

"The Love-god with a plethora of provocative autumnal features will be prolongedly
agonising her, because she is separated from me, and because her ladyship is a frailty - won't he?"
Thus Rama worried for Seetha. [4-30-12]

So on and so forth that best one among men and the son of a king keened over, like a
Rain-cuckoo which will be keen on Indra, the king of divinities, for rainy-water. [4-30-13]

Meandering on the pleasant mountain-terraces in search of fruits brilliant Lakshmana
returned and has seen his elder brother Rama. [4-30-14]

Noble-hearted Saumitri, on observing lone Rama in a lonely place, who is beset with
unbearable sadness and whose posture is vacuous, became very miserable for the sad condition of his
brother, and spoke to Rama fretfully. [4-30-15]

"Oh, noble one, what is the use in getting into fetters of passion, what for soul's
bold-temper is being trounced, this remorseful sadness is arrogating self-assurance, and what
purpose can be achieved now in retracing steps from the goal. [4-30-16]

"Oh, dear sir, engage yourself in your mission with an undeterred spirit and with a
good disposition of mind, and bring time under control with steadfastness and ideation, and the
capabilities of your helpmates, say Sugreeva and others be gathered, and the basis for your
achievements, say daily rituals towards gods, be performed by you as your means. [4-30-17]

"Oh, the lord of human kindred, with you as her husband Janaki is not an easily
attainable one for others, oh, highly honourable one, if it is said that none will be burnt if he
nears the tongues of flaming fire, oh, brave one, it is not so, for Janaki is a flaming fire, and
anyone nearing her in ill-will will be burnt to ashes like a grass-hopper." Thus Lakshmana said to
Rama. [4-30-18]

Lakshmana with his seemliness spoke those undeniable and expedient words that
emerged from his very nature, which are tasteful, morally abiding, and further abounding with
friendliness, righteousness, and meaningfulness, and on listening such words Rama spoke to
Lakshmana.

Rama spoke to seemly and undeniable Lakshmana with words that emerged from his very
nature, which are tasteful, morally abiding, and further abounding with friendliness,
righteousness, and meaningfulness.[4-30-19]

"Doubtless accomplishment of the task is to be held in view, even oh, boy, the
factors that contribute to its accomplishment, like enthusiasm, helpmates etc., are to be followed
through, and not only these aspects but we also have to observe the fruition of task when that task
is becoming unwieldy, unattainable and formidable, along with the lapse of time and lapsing of
help." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [4-30-20]

On thinking about the fruit of his mammoth task, namely that lotus-petal-eyed
Maithili, thereafter Rama spoke to Lakshmana with a dried-up face. [4-30-21]

"On satisfying mother earth with rainwater and on effectuating the crops on earth,
the Thousand-eyed Indra is complacent as his task is effectuated, whereas my task is yet to take
off. [4-30-22]

"Clouds roving on the tops of mountains and trees with their protracted and profound
peals have let the water loose and they are now retired, oh, prince, but tireless are rumbles and
grumbles in my heart, thus I cannot retire. [4-30-23]

"On blackening ten quarters of earth blue-black clouds that looked like petals of
blue-lotuses are now quietened in their nimbleness like rut-less elephants. [4-30-24]

"Now pausing are the high-speeded rainy-winds, which once speedily swooped with
water in their wombs, and wafted the fragrance of Kutaja and Arjuna flowers. [4-30-25]

"The rales of clouds, elephants, peacocks, and oh, merited Lakshmana, of the
freshets too, are suddenly quietened. [4-30-26]

"Scoured well by rains from colossal clouds those amusing mountain terraces are
grime-less and they shine forth as though enamelled with the moonbeams. [4-30-27]

"Presently autumn has shown itself dividing its charm on the branches of
seven-leaved banana plants, on the stars, sun and moon, and also on those best elephants that are
rollicking. [4-30-28]

"Fascinatingly glistening grandeur of autumn that is derived from the merits of the
season and that resorts to many objects of the season, is now splendidly shining in the lotus lakes
that are flourished by the rays of dawning sun. [4-30-29]

"The breeze is wafting the fragrance of flowers of seven-leaved banana plants, and
the swarms of honeybees that are singing in accompaniment to the rustle of breeze are tagging along
that breeze for its fragrance, and because that breeze is breezing unceasingly, that alone is
fetching the pride of rut for the already rutted elephants, and thus this autumnal season is highly
glistening. [4-30-30]

"Broad and cute winged Cakravaka birds that are fond of lakes and that have pollen
of lotuses overspread on them have come to the sand-dunes of vast rivers, and with them that have
come nigh the swans are larking. [4-30-31]

"Divided variously the autumnal glory is shining forth among the overbearingly
ruttish elephants that are trumpeting, among the herds of haughty bulls bellowing, and among the
limpid waters that are murmuringly slopping down. [4-30-32]

"Exploring the sky well which is now set free by the clouds, the peacocks are
setting their ornamental plumaged-tails free, and they are even divested of their dear peahens as
they are uninterested in them, and thus divested of their festivity those peacocks are abiding in
their muse. [4-30-33]

"Umpteen are those Priyaka trees with their pleasingly fragrant flowers, the apices
of the boughs of those trees are sagging down by their much weighty flowers-bunches, and
eye-delighting is the golden-yellow hue of those flowers, and with them the interiors of these
forests look as though illuminated, lit with golden lamps. [4-30-34]

"On scenting the fragrance of the seven-leaved banana plants, the ruttish lather of
those best elephants that have a fond for forests and lotus-lakes has started to flow on their
temples, thus they are indulgent in rut and their strides are slackening while they are moving
along with their beloved female elephants. [4-30-35]

"The sky is clear as with the tinge of just whetted weapon, lessened are the flows
of river-waters, breeze is chilly while wafting the chillness of red-lotuses, and all the
directions released from the darkness are looking bright. [4-30-36]

"Overcome by the sun's heat dried out is the sludge, at last the earth is dense with
the up-heaved dust, and for the lords of people who have mutual animosity this is the time to
foregather their forces to strive against one another. [4-30-37]

"The nature of autumn has enhanced the features of bulls' bullishness and with their
bodies covered with dust and their vigour pepping them up they are ecstatic, and staying in the
midst of cowherd they are bellowing hankering for bullfights. [4-30-38]

"While a ruttish male elephant is going in the forest the slow paced she-elephant is
tagging along her male along with other elephants of her breed, and with an intensified attachment
and passion she is bumping and rubbing her husband. [4-30-39]

"The excellent plumaged-tails that form their individual ornaments of peacocks are
now cast out, and the plumeless peacocks on nearing the banks of rivers they look as if intimidated
by the Saarasa birds, thus they had to turn back despondently and dispiritedly. [4-30-40]

"With their blaring trumpeting lordly elephants with slit temples are alarming
Karandava and Cakravaka birds abiding in lakes that are embellished with blooming lotuses, and
those elephants are drinking water after swishing and swashing the tranquillity of those lakes.
[4-30-41]

"De-silted is the silt of rivers and they are with sand-dunes and serene waters, and
cow-stock is gathering there, besides, they are resonant with clucking of Saarasa birds, in such
rivers swans are delightedly taking deep dives. [4-30-42]

"The ruffles of rivers, rumbles of clouds, rattles of rapids, such rackets of waters
are quietened, and much amplified gusts of wind, and screams of peacocks along with crocks of
frogs, are now completely undone as their festivity is definitely lost with the rains.
[4-30-43]

"Variously coloured and dangerously venomous snakes have contracted into their snake
pits with the advent of new rain clouds, and containing in there for a long time they are highly
emaciated for they are hunger-stricken, but now they are snaking out of those pits. [4-30-44]

"Aha! By the touch of the moonbeam of the shining moon, the damsel called twilight
is delightedly unfolding the stars releasing her ochry hue off the sky on her own, in all her love
for the moon.

"Aha! By the touch of the hand of her twinkling hero a damsel in all her love to him
is delightedly widening her pupils and disrobing her ochry robe on her own. [4-30-45]

"Damsel-night is with the risen-moon as her genteel-face, myriad-stars as her
twinkling-eyes, moonlight as her veiling-cloth, and she is glistening like the one who
fully-enfolded her limbs within a whitish-cloth-like moonshine. [4-30-46]

"On eating richly ripened yield of rice delighted are the Saarasa birds, and in a
delightful bird-line with swift speed they are overrunning the sky like a stringed flowery-tassel
up-heaved by wind. [4-30-47]

"One swan is sleeping in the water of a vast lake thick with white-lotuses, and that
lake is glistening like the star-studded nightly skyscape that is disengaged from clouds, and that
has the full-moon. [4-30-48]

"With swans spreading and swaying around as her swaying girdle-ornaments, and with
well-bloomed red and blue lotuses as her swinging flowery-tassels, the resplendence of those best
tanks is now heightening as with a dame embellished with girdle-ornaments and flowery-tassels.
[4-30-49]

"In tune with the tunes of flute the dawn-time breeze is tuned-up, and it is
spreading to broadcast the tuneful tunes from the caves, cows and bulls, and the sounds are as
though surpassing one another. [4-30-50]

"The riverbanks are with smiley white flowers of new reeds that are softly swayed by
the gentle breeze, and the silken reed-bed on them is shining forth like a well-washed white
silk-cloth that is shiny. [4-30-51]

"Honeybees that are on the loose in forests and roguish in drinking honey are
yellowed with the pollen of lotuses and asana flowers when they had bouts of nectar, and they are
saucily but delightedly making their journey along with their lady-loves in tow with the forest
breeze. [4-30-52]

"Waters are standing tranquilly, flowers are smiley, crane-birds are noisily,
rice-crops are ripely, breeze is softly, and moon is brightly, thus they denote the time of rains
has phased out. [4-30-53]

"In the dame-like rivers fish are very closely seen as if they are girdle ornaments
of that dame, and nowadays these dames are strutting slothfully like ladyloves who strut tiresomely
in the early morning of next day, after a nightlong romancing with their lovers. [4-30-54]

"With Cakravaka birds, with riverweeds, and with reeds that lookalike a veiling
silk-cloth, half-veiled are the river-shores and they look painted with foliage-lines in vermilion,
like the faces of maidens. [4-30-55]

"In the forest that is portrayed with the flourishing Baana and Asana trees, where
the honeybees are humming elatedly, there alone the Love-god, Manmatha, is moving about unimpededly
taking his bow to punish the lovesick. [4-30-56]

"On appeasing the world with good rains, on filling the rivers and tanks, and on
making the earth to derive good harvests also, clouds have dissipated forsaking the sky.
[4-30-57]

"The autumnal rivers are showing their dunes slowly and slowly, as with shying
brides showing hips in their new trysts, slowly and slowly. [4-30-58]

"Oh, gentle Lakshmana, with clear waters, well sounding fish-hawks, teeming teams of
Cakravaka birds the lakes are glistening well. [4-30-59]

"Oh, prince, those that are reciprocally bound by hostilities and desirous of
victory, oh, gentle Lakshmana, for those kings their striving time has come up. [4-30-60]

"This is the starting time for invasions of the kings, but I do not even perceive
Sugreeva, or his striving for any invasion as such. [4-30-61]

"On mountain terraces there appear flowered Asana trees, seven-leaved banana plants,
Kovidaara, Bandhujiiva trees, and the Shyaama creepers. [4-30-62]

"On the sand-dunes of rivers Swans, Saarasa-s, Cakravaka-s, also Kraunca birds are
fully overspreading from all over, see Lakshmana. [4-30-63]

"Four rainy months have rolled by and to me they are like a hundred years, for I
have not seen Seetha, likewise I am seethed in grief. [4-30-64]

"Like a female Cakravaka bird that follows rearward of her husband, that lady Seetha
followed her husband, that is what I am, to the precarious forest of Dandaka, as if she is going to
pleasure-gardens. [4-30-65]

"Dear departed, kingdom plundered, rendered homeless, and one in desperate straits,
such as I am Lakshmana, king Sugreeva is not benevolent to me. [4-30-66]

" 'He is insecure, kingdom forfeited, persecuted by Ravana, a dismal, came from a
distant home, lovelorn and sought shelter in me alone...' thus Sugreeva may be thinking of me.

" ' Since his kingdom is forfeited, he is an insecure person... since he is
persecuted by a powerful demon Ravana, he is dismal... since he came from a distant homeland, he
hasn't got a leg to stand on... since he is lovelorn, he sought my shelter faint-heartedly...' thus
Sugreeva may be thinking of me. [4-30-67]

"By these reasons, oh gentle Lakshmana, I am perhaps scoffed off by the spiteful
king of Vanara-s Sugreeva oh, the enemy-blazer, Lakshmana. [4-30-68]

"He computed the time for search of Seetha well, and entered into a treaty with me
as well, but on achieving his means that base-minded one is unmindful of it. [4-30-69]

"Oh, enemy blazer Lakshmana, such as you are, you enter Kishkindha and upon my word
speak to that arch-vanara Sugreeva, which stupid is tangled up in uncouth pleasures. [4-30-70]

" 'He who promises the requesters that have come under his shelter, and especially
those that have cooperated earlier, but breaks that promise, and even shatters their hope, he is
the worst fellow in the world. [4-30-71]

" 'Whether it is good or bad, he who promises a word, and truthfully takes action
for its accomplishment, indeed he is the champion and a best one among men. [4-30-72]

" 'Indeed, those that have achieved their means through their friends, but do not
come to the rescue of the same friends whose means are still unachieved, the carrion-devourers will
not devour even the flesh of those ingrates after their death. [4-30-73]

" 'You definitely aspire to see that facet of the gold-spined bow of mine which in
simile will be like a cluster of electric-discharges when I fully stretch it in war. [4-30-74]

" 'Once more you desire to clearly hear that calamitous crashing boom from my
bowstring, which is a soundalike with the crash of thunderbolt, when I angrily clang the unbent
bowstring in a given war. [4-30-75]

"But, oh, prince Lakshmana, Sugreeva is fully aware of my valour... be that as it
may... oh, brave one, I am not alarmed as I have you as my associate. [4-30-76]

"For which reason this venture of eliminating Vali and its sequel is commenced, oh,
the vanquisher of enemy-capitals, Lakshmana, and the timeframe set for it, that king of fly-jumpers
Sugreeva is not recognising, as his ends are achieved. [4-30-77]

"But on promising to get back after rainy season that king of vanara-s is insensible
to the slipping away of those four months time of rainy season, for he is wallowing in his
pleasures. [4-30-78]

"Frolicking with all in the council of ministers Sugreeva is absorbed in drinking
alone, and he is not sympathising with us who are agonised by grief. [4-30-79]

"Oh, great-mighty Lakshmana, you may proceed to Kishkindha and let Sugreeva know
through you as to how my fury takes shape, and oh, brave one, he may be told this word also.
[4-30-80]

" 'Oh, Sugreeva, abide by your commitment. The path by which slain Vali has gone is
not tapered off, as such do not tread Vali's path. [4-30-81]

" 'In a clash Vali is slain singly with my arrow, but I wish to slay you along with
your kith and kin since you have transgressed truthfulness. [4-30-82]

"Oh, best one among men, Lakshmana, when the mission of searching for Seetha is
scheduled in this way but hampered, you speak about all things that are appropriate for us and for
Sugreeva even, oh, foremost one among men, hurry up, let there be no time lapse. [4-30-83]

" 'Oh, king of monkeys, on apperceiving the perpetual virtuousness in what you have
promised to me, render it as a reality. Otherwise, now driven by my arrows to death, and on going
to Yama, the Time-god's Inferno, you will see Vali " Thus Rama appraised Lakshmana about his
thinking of Sugreeva. [4-30-84]

On clearly examining his elder brother Rama, who has become ruthlessly
uncompassionate and pitiably prating, the mood of that intensively resplendent Lakshmana, who is an
augmenter of Manu's dynasty, has become hostile towards the monkey-king Sugreeva. [4-30-85]

Rama, on arriving at that Lake of Lotuses called Pampa along with Lakshmana, which is full with lotuses, 
costuses, and fishes, lamented as his emotions are disturbed, on seeing the beauty of the Lake comparable 
with Seetha's face. [4-1-1]

There, on seeing that Lake of Lotuses, thrilled are his senses with gladness, and he engrossed and overcame 
by passion spoke this way to Lakshmana. [4-1-2]

"Oh! Soumitri, magnificent is Pampa Lake with its cat's-eye-gem like waters, and she with her fully 
bloomed lotuses and costuses is beaming forth, along with many trees around her. [3-1-3]

"Oh! Soumitri, see the forest of Pampa, the auspicious one in its appearance... where the mountains 
or trees lustre with their mountainous peaks... [4-1-4]

"But I, who am well seethed by the anguish of Bharata, and even by the abduction of Seetha, am indeed 
distressed by my sensibilities and their distresses... [4-1-5]

"This auspicious Pampa is pleasant to me with its delightful forests overspread with many diverse flowers, 
cool waters, though I am disquieted... [4-1-6]

"Even enwreathed with lotuses this is remarkably sacred in its aspect... rambling snakes and elephants 
and restless are the deer and birds flocks, as well... [4-1-7]

"All this is shining very much with bluish, yellowish grassland with a variety of trees... and with 
flowers covering it like flowery bed-sheet with variegated colours... [4-1-8]

"Everywhere the treetops are fully flowered and the onus of those flowers is on the rise, though they 
are wholly embraced by climbers and their apices. [4-1-9]

"Pleasing is this breeze, oh! Soumitri, and Manmadha, the Love God, prevails at this time, and prideful 
is this month with its fragrance, flowers, fruits and trees... all anew... [4-1-10]

"See this figuration of these forests enriched with these flowers, Soumitri! Outpouring is the flower 
rain, like the rain from rain-clouds... [4-1-11]

"Also on those appeasing terraces of mountains there are many forest trees... speed of winds are swinging 
them to shower flowers onto ground... [4-1-12]

"These are the flowers already fallen, about to fall, or still on the trees, but everywhere the air 
is playing with these flowers, see that Lakshmana... [4-1-13]

"The honeybees are displaced when the wind rapidly moved numerous branches of trees with full of flowers, 
and though displaced those bees are singing as though in accompaniment to the singing breeze... [4-1-14]

"Breeze coming out from those mountain caves along with the high callings of lusty black cuckoos are 
making the trees to dance, and the air itself is as though singing as an accompaniment to that dancing... 
[4-1-15]

"Entwined are the spires of trees when muchly moved by the air, thus the trees themselves seem to be 
entwined one with the other... [4-1-16]

"He, this breeze is thus a happy one for touch, carrying a coolant and the fragrance like that of the 
sandalwood, and this breezing is a merited one and a fatigue remover... [4-1-17]

"Air is vacillating these trees in this honey scented forest... and the trees appear to be enjoying 
their fluttering dance and seem to be swinging their treetops to appreciate the singing of honeybees 
that are humming in accompaniment to this dance... [4-1-18]

"On mountain-planes that are beautiful with fully flowered and pleasant tress that entwine the mountain 
peaks with their high treetops, and thus these mountains indeed liven up with these great trees...[4-1-19]

"Air is moving the treetops fully covered with flowers to swinging and the coronet like honeybees have 
to swing around those treetops, thus these trees themselves appear to be dancing to be dancing and singing... 
[4-1-20]

"Fully flowered are these Karnikaara plants all over with golden colour flowers at top and yellow coloured 
stems, and they look like men wearing golden ornaments on their upper body, while their loin cloth is 
yellow... [4-1-21]

"This spring with the soundings of many birds, oh! Soumitri, is enkindling grief in me, for Seetha is 
disunited...[4-1-22]

"I, who am already pervaded by grief, am now well sweltered by the Love God, and this cuckoo that has 
happy calls is rather calling me down... [4-1-23]

"This gallinule bird happily calling in the forest brooks is making me awesome with its calls, as the 
Love-god has already made me awestricken... [4-1-24]

"Earlier when we were in hermitage, on hearing this bird's call, dear Seetha used to call me to listen, 
and she herself was highly cheerful at this bird's calls... [4-1-25]

"Very many amusing birds of that kind are flitting all over on trees, bushes, and creepers emitting 
very many sounds... see them, Lakshmana... [4-1-26]

"Well mingled are these female birds with their male ones, for which they are well admired by their 
own flock, oh! Soumitri, and such birds are calling gladsomely together with the pleasing humming of 
king-bees... [4-1-27]

"At the shore of this Lake Pampa rejoicing are these birds in groups, and these trees loaded with the 
mating sounds of gallinule birds, and even loaded the callings of the male black cuckoos, are while 
inciting me they are inspiring love in me... [4-1-28, 29a]

"The fire called spring season will burn me down with its fiery paraphernalia like the clusters of red 
flowers of hellebore that are akin to fireballs, the humming of honeybees that is alike the rustle of 
campfires, and the coppery red colour of tender leaves just sprouted that is identical to burning fire... 
[4-1-29b, 30a]

"And if she with slender eyelids on her eyes, decent hairdo, and a soft spoken one, Oh! Soumitri, if 
she is unseen by me will there be any purposefulness of my life? [4-1-30b, 31a]

"My dear Seetha has an enchantment for these enchanting woodlands bustling with koels up to their horizons, 
and Lakshmana, similarly enchanting is this vernal season to her... [4-1-31b, 32a]

"This fire of grief born out of the throes of love, and furthered by the attributes of spring season 
will swiftly burn me down in no time... [4-1-32]

"As the one unable to see that lady but able to see beautiful trees the Love-god in me gains intensity... 
[4-1-33b, 34a]

"Now, that invisible Seetha is intensifying my agony, and this visible spring season, the remover of 
the touch of sweat too, is doing the same... [4-1-34b, 35a]

"Overwhelmed with the grief of worry about that deer eyed Seetha, such as I am, I am burnt down by this 
cruel vernal breeze of forests...[4-1-35b, 36a]

"And these peacocks that dance here and there are shining forth with crystal like windows on their plumage, 
when up-shoved by the wind...[4-1-36b, 37a]

"Those peacocks that are surorounded by their peahens and convulsed in love are intensifying longing 
in me, who am already muffled in love-longing... [4-1-37b, 38a]

"See Lakshmana, on that mountain terrace this peahen longing for love is dancing at the nearby of her 
husband, that peacock... [4-1-38b, 39a]

"Spreading his beautiful wings and screaming as though joking, even that peacock is longingly running 
after his female... [4-1-39b, 40a]

"Definitely no demon has abducted that peacock's ladylove, hence he is dancing with her in beautiful 
forests... [4-1-40b, 41a]

"Living in this flowering month is unbearable for me... Lakshmana, see the fondness even in those originated 
in animals, thus that peahen in her passion is following her husband... [4-1-41b, 42]

"Had she, that broad eyed lady Seetha, not been abducted, she too would have followed me in this way 
with an ecstatic love... [4-1-43]

"See Lakshmana, while these forests are abundantly weighty with flowers in wintry season these flowers 
are becoming futile to me... [4-1-44]

"Though these flowers on the trees are exceedingly beautiful they are falling onto the earth wastefully, 
along with the swarms of honeybees hovering over them... [4-1-45.]

"These blithesome birds appear to be inviting each other in mutual consent, and they are melodious calling 
as they like, and this is causing love madness in me... [4-1-46]

"Should this spring season be there too, where my dear one Seetha is living, she with her unrequited 
merriment will definitely be saddened like me... [4-1-47]

"Definitely this spring season will not touch that place where she is... and even if this touches that 
place, how can that lady with black-lotus-eyes can possibly comport without me! [4-1-48]

"Otherwise, even if the spring happens to be there where my dear is, what can that fine waisted lady 
do under threat by others? [4-1-49]

"She in midst of her youth, eyes like lotus petals, also soft-spoken one is my dear one... and definitely 
taken by the spring she leaves her life... [4-1-50]

"Indeed in my heart a strong notion is prevailing that the chaste lady Seetha will be unable to live 
separated from me... [4-1-51]

"My thoughts of Seetha alone are well biding in me, and in Seetha also thoughts about me will always 
be abiding... [4-1-52.]

"This breeze carrying fragrance of flowers is though pleasant for touch and though coolish like snow, 
this alone is like fire to me as I am very much worried about that lady... [4-1-53]

"By which breeze I always felt happiness earlier along with Seetha... that breeze alone is increasing 
anguish in me without Seetha... [4-1-54]

"When Seetha was with me, then this crow flew into the sky and cawed much indicating Seetha's departure 
from me, and now sitting on a tree it is cawing agreeably indicating early arrival of Seetha... [4-1-55]

"This bird alone, then roving in the sky indicated about the abduction of Seetha... and this very same 
bird will now lead me near to that broad eyed one... [4-1-56]

"Lakshmana, observe the appealing tonality of birds in the forest that calling out atop the flowered 
trees, that which is indeed furthering one's passion� [4-1-57]

"That honeybee is quickly reaching these red flowers bouquets of Tilaka that are like his loved ones 
that are raising their faces with vigour�[4-1-58]

"To the impassioned ones that Ashoka tree is very much enhancing grief, and with its bouquets of flowers 
hustled up by the wind it is sanding as though to daunt me... [4-1-59]

" Lakshmana, these mango trees bearing greenish yellow flower are appearing like men whose hearts are 
flirtatiously aroused, and who have creamed their bodies with greenish-yellow body cream� [4-1-60]

"Oh, tigerly man Soumitri, see these Pampa's amazing forests ranges... and therein the nymphs are moving, 
hither and yon... [4-1-61]

"See Lakshmana, these fragrant and propitious blue lotuses are everywhere in the waters, glistening 
like tender sun... [4-1-62]

"This Pampa Lake is shining forth with its tranquil waters, that contain lotuses, blue water-lily's, 
and red lotuses, along with swans and water-birds that permeate it � [4-1-63]

"Lotuses with the resplendence of tender sun enwrapping its waters, pollen grain pilfered by honeybees 
enwrapping those lotuses� with them this Pampa is beaming forth�

"This Pampa is always bedecked with the ruddy geese, amazing deep areas of the forest, and with water 
thirsty herds of elephants and deer, and with them it gleams forth... [4-1-65]

"In the tranquil water the speed of wind is throbbing ripples, and the ripples throb the lotuses, thus 
the throbbing and rippling lotuses appear beautiful� [4-1-66]

"That one with lotus-petal-like broad eyes, who always holds the lotuses dear...without finding that 
Vaidehi... to me my life is uninteresting... [4-1-67]

"Aha! Deplorable is the deviousness of Love-god, for he is causing reminisces about that graceful lady 
who articulates that gracefully, even if she is gone away and cannot be regained now... [4-1-68]

"If this spring with its flowered trees is not going to deaden me... the Love-god is a possible one 
to tolerate, though now he came upon me forcefully...[4-1-69]

"All those places or objects that were delightful ones to me when she was with me, and they alone are 
now becoming anguishing ones to me...for she parted from me� [4-1-70]

"To gaze the petals of the lotus buds my sight is fascinated... and in them I perceive the pair of Seetha's 
bud-like eyes...Oh! Lakshmana...and they are alike thus... [4-1-71]

"This breeze� let out from within the thickets of forests, breezing touching the pollen of lotuses, 
is reminding Seetha's exhale, as such it is heart-stealing� [4-1-72]

"Soumitri, see those flowered Karnikara trees with their tree-trunks on those southern hill-terraces 
of Pampa, they are highly splendorous... [4-1-73]

"That one, that kingly mountain which is ornamentally impregnated with ores and minerals is exhausting 
much mass of wondrous dust with the colour of its ores, that is drifted by the wind's speed... [4-1-74]

"On the mountainsides, Soumitri, all over fully flowered are the exquisite Kimshuka trees, while their 
leaves are hidden under those reddish flowers, and with them that mountain is as though aglow... [4-1-75]

"On the banks of Pampa these jasmines, water-lilies, red oleanders have grown up and they are now flowered 
that is wetted with the fragrance of nectar...[4-1-76]

"The Mogra bushes, Sinduka, Vaasanti are well flowered. Maadhavi, flowers are also fully fragrant, and 
everywhere there are bushes of Jasmine... [4-1-77]

"Charming are the saplings of Bilva, and Madhooka, and plants like Vakula, Champaka, Tilaka, Naaga trees 
are well flowered.... [4-1-78]

"Padmaka plants are well flourishing, and like that Neela, Ashoka are also flowered... trees on the 
mountain terraces namely Lodhra trees are brownish like lion's mane... [4-1-79]

"The trees of Alangium, Kurntaka, Poornaka, Devadaaru, and also the Mango trees, and like that Patala 
trees, and the trees of Mountain ebony are flowered...[4-1-80]

"Muchukunda trees, also Arjuna trees are seen on mountain terraces...Date palm trees, Uddaalaka trees 
also... like that the Shiriisha tree, simshupa trees, and dhava trees... [4-1-81]

"Silk cotton trees, palaasha trees also, like that are red mehandi trees, thus are Tinisha and Naktamaala 
trees, sandalwood trees, spandana trees are all thus well flowered... [4-1-82]

"Flowered are the trees like hintaala, tilaka, and naaga trees, and they are enfolded by the flowered 
climber-plants at their apices... [4-1-83]

"See the splendorous trees of Pampa here, oh! Soumitri...their branches bestirred by wind and bend onto 
other trees, as though these trees are nearby and within the reach of climber-plants... thus the climber-plants 
passionately bear upon those trees, like the doting of passionate women... [ [4-1-84, 85a]

"And the breeze is perhaps unhappy by savouring only one kind of nectarine aroma, hence it appears to 
be gliding from tree to tree, forest to forest, mountain to mountain... while going from tree to tree, 
mountain to mountain, forest to forest... [4-1-85b, 86a]

"Some trees are full with flowers whose nectar is fragrant, and some shine forth with dark colour as 
they are enveloped with buds... [4-1-86b, 87a]

"And the honeybee on assessing each of the flower as 'this one is pure... this one is delicious... and 
this one is well bloomed...' is plunging into them... [4-1-87b, 88a]

"On plunging into the flowers that nectar-avaricious honeybee is again coming up, and quickly going 
elsewhere in the trees on the banks of Pampa... [4-1-8]

"These clusters of flowers that have fallen on their own are spreading out like a bed of flowers laid 
on, with them the ground appears to endow comfort... [4-1-89]

"On mountain slopes varied flowers are spread out, with them the colour of diverse mountain slabs is 
rendered into yellow-red hue... [4-1-90]

"Soumitri see the bloom of flowers in spring after winter, as if the trees have indeed bore the flowers 
in competition with one another... [4-1-91]

"The drones of honeybees among the trees with flowered treetops appear to be the talk of trees, and 
the swinging branches of trees appear to be their invitational gestures to one another, thus those trees 
look highly attractive... [4-1-92]

"Entering the blessed waters this bird, partridge, is rejoicing together with his female, kindling desire 
in me too... [4-1-93]

"This sort of heart pleasing nature is also available with River Ganga, and that alone reasonably signifies 
the popularity of River Pampa in the world... [4-1-94]

"If that devot lady Seetha is found, and also if we were to stay here only, I neither think about Indra's 
throne in Heavens nor Ayodhya's throne, which is like Indra's throne on the earth... [4-1-95]

"Nay... if I were to take delight this way in these pleasant green meadows along with her, there will 
be no worry to me... nor interest in other things... [4-1-96]

"Indeed these beautifully leaved and variously flowered trees are maddening my heart as I am without 
that lady Seetha in this forest... [4-1-97]

"See the cool water of this Pampa Lake, Soumitri, filled with blue lotuses, and with ruddy geese well 
moving in, and well venerated by the partridge birds...[4-1-98]

"Well filled with waterfowls, curlew birds, and adored by great animals, this Pampa glistens much with 
pleasantly calling birds...[4-1-99]

"Enkindling passion in me, are these umpteen gladdened birds, reminding me of my dear one who is in 
the mid of her youth, moonfaced, and with the radiance of lotuses in her eyes... [4-1-100]

"See that female deer along with male deer moving there and there on those wonderful mountainsides... 
and at me, who am weaned away from such a fawn-eyed lady Seetha... and such as I am, my heart is further 
agonised on seeing these wide-eyed deer, and for not seeing her, the wide-eyed Seetha... [4-1-101]

"If only I can see that lady on those spectacular terraces filled with impassioned bird groups with 
much ado, then there shall be peace for me... [4-1-102]

"I live along for sure, Soumitri, if that slender-waisted Vaidehi basks in this benignant breeze of 
Pampa along with me... [4-1-103]

""Lakshmana, the breeze from the greenswards of Pampa that carries the fragrance of lotuses including 
that of red lotuses is an auspicious one, an eliminator of melancholy, and those that adore such a breeze 
are fortunate ones... [4-1-104]

"That youthful, lotus-petal eyed beloved of mine, that Janaka's daughter... how can that helpless lady 
bear her lives without me... [4-1-105]

"What sort of well-being can I say to that virtuous and truth speaking King Janaka, if he enquires about 
Seetha's well-being among hosts of people? [4-1-106]

"She who accompanied me, an unfortunate one whom his father sent to forests, taking up a virtuous course... 
now where will be she, that ladylove of mine, be abiding... [4-1-107]

"Whose kingdom is forfeited, and whose soul succumbed to the circumstance at the time of exile, but 
she accompanied suchlike me, and Lakshmana, without her how I can I live on in desolation... [4-1-108]

"She who has a pretty and beaming face with lotus-like eyes, that is fragrant, auspicious and scarless, 
and not seeing such a face my mind is as though sinking... [4-1-109]

" Lakshmana, when can I hear that conversation of Vaidehi that will have smiles and wits in between... 
wisdom wise pleasing, friendly and unique one in its own way... [4-1-110]

"That youthful and decent lady though succumbed to suffering in forests used to look as though got rid 
of her sufferings, and as though gladsome woman, and she used to speak to me, one smitten by her love, 
very fondly... [4-1-111]

"What can I say in Ayodhya to that kind hearted lady and my mother Kausalya, oh, prince Lakshmana, when 
she asks �where is she, my daughter-in-law? And how is she? ' [4-1-112]

"Begone! Lakshmana.... you may see Bharata, that affectionate one for his brothers... I may not be able 
to live on leaving off Seetha... isn't so!" [So said Rama to Lakshmana] [4-1-113]

To that great-souled Rama who is bewailing that way like a waif, his brother Lakshmana said these appropriate 
and infallible words. [4-1-114]

"Oh, best one among men, please control yourself Rama, let safety betide you, do not lament, the intellect 
of your kind of unblemished souls does not become languorous... [4-1-115]

"Recollect the sadness caused by departure of loved ones, and it may please be forsaken for some extent, 
with the embrace of too much of friendship of the water-drenched wick with oil, even that water-drenched 
wick burns in the lamp... [4-1-116]

"On remembering the fondness for dear ones, intellect of your kind of unblemished souls will not become 
languorous. Leave off the sadness caused by separation.

"If Ravana goes to the netherworlds, or still deeper worlds from there, oh my brother, still he will 
not live, Raghava... [4-1-117]

"Let the emplacement of that sinning demon e obtained... and then he either cedes Seetha or enters into 
his own doom... [4-1-118]

"Even if he enters the womb of Diti along with Seetha, and if he does not give away Seetha, even there 
I wish to slay him,...[4-1-119]

"May you rejuvenate and be secure, oh, revered one, cast-off your pathetic mood... result of purpose 
will be lost indeed, for the endeavourers without a try, thus nothing can be regained by them... [4-1-120]

"Vehemence is might, oh, noble one, there is no superior might than vehemence and to him with vehemence 
there is no impossibility in the world,... even the slightest... [4-1-121]

"Vehement men do not regress in deeds, and taking hold of vehemence alone we regain Seetha...[4-1-122]

"You leave off this enclosure of ardency and pushback that compassion ... you are not able to know your 
great and controlled soul...with these thoughts of self-pity and fondness... [4-1-123]

Thus addressed by Lakshmana, then Rama whose conscience is marred by emotions, got rid of pity and fondness, 
and acquired courage, to perform the deed demanded of his incarnation. [4-1-124]

He that inestimable valiant Rama strode forward those areas of charming Pampa Lake, with the charm of 
wind-flopped trees, getting rid of grief. [4-1-125]

That great one Rama on observing all over quickly, all round the forest with its brooks and caves, and 
reviewing with Lakshmana, though agonised at heart that anguished one travelled on. [4-1-126]

While that great soul Rama is walking ahead, that great souled Lakshmana whose stride is also like that 
of an elephant, and whose deeds are agreeable to Rama, vigilantly protected Rama with an un-despaired 
mind and even by his virtue and strength. [4-1-127]

He who is the chief of Vanara-s, who moves about Mt. Rishyamuka, while he is meandering thereabout he 
happened to see those two who are so amazing for a look, namely Rama and Lakshmana, by which he is so 
frightened that he is petrified. [4-1-128]

On seeing those two Rama and Lakshmana who are advancing his way, he that great soul who is a tree-branch 
animal, and he who strides like an elephant, derived profound agony that muffled him in worry, and he 
is engulfed under the weight of his fear. [4-1-129]

On seeing those magnificent two, Rama and Lakshmana, the monkeys are frightened and fled towards the 
pious hermitage of Sage Matanga, which has an inland that is always adored by monkeys for it is consolatory 
and sheltering them. [4-1-130]
