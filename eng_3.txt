 Then, on receiving the hospitality in that hermitage for that day, and on the next
  day before sunrise, Rama bade farewell to all of the sages, and thus entered the deep forests.
  [3-2-1]


 Rama followed by Lakshmana has indeed seen that midst of the forest which is
  filled with very many animal herds, where the bears and tigers are frequenting, and whose trees,
  creepers, bushes are ruined, water ponds rendered unsightly, birds song-less, but where the
  swarms of crickets are whistling deafeningly. [3-3-2, 3]


 Therein Rama has seen along with Seetha, a lurid voiced man-eater who is akin to a
  mountain-peak, among horrendous animals. [3-2-4]


 Deep eyed, huge mouthed, horrible with a monstrous belly, hideously misshapen, and
  a very soaring one that demon is, an ugly one with a horrendous look. [3-2-5]


 Wearing tiger's skin that is wetted with fat and dampened with blood, he is
  frightening to all beings like the wide-open mouth of Death. [3-2-6]


 He skewered three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten spotted deer, and a big head
  of an elephant with tusks and fouled with fat on an iron spear, and he is yelling with his
  deafening voice. [3-2-7-8a]


 He that demon on seeing Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha ran towards them very angrily,
  like the Time, the Eliminator of people. [3-2-8b-9a]


 He shouted a tremulous blare, as though to tremor the earth, and seized Vaidehi
  with his arms and gone afar, and then said this way. [9b-10a]


 "You two wear jute cloths like hermits, but handle arrows, bows and swords like
  warriors, yet entered Dandaka forest with your wife... your lives are on the wane...
  [3-2-10b-11a]


 "How saintly are you while living with your wife? You sinful fellows dishonest are
  you ways... who are you... you insulters of sainthood? [3-2-11b-12a]


 "I am a demon named Viradha and I will be on the rove in this impassable forest
  with weapon, always eating the flesh of sages... [3-2-12b-13a]


 "This best waisted woman will be my wife, and I will drink your blood of you two
  sinful one in a fight with you... [3-2-13b-14a]


 On listening those arrogant words spoken in bad intent by that evil minded
  Viradha, Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, is much panicked. [3-2-14b-15a.]


 Seetha in fear wiggled like a plantain tree in a whirlwind, and on seeing at the
  auspicious lady gone into the arms of Viradha, Raghava spoke this sentence to Lakshmana, with his
  face fully turning to pale. [3-2-15b-16]


 "See! Gentle Lakshmana, see that illustrious princes Seetha, the daughter of
  emperor Janaka, one who is brought up comfortably in immense comfort, and my auspiciously
  traditional wife... now gone into the wretched hands of a demon... [3-2-17-18a]


 "That which is desired to befall on us, and that which is the choicest desire of
  Kaikeyi, and that which is concomitant to her boons, oh, Lakshmana, that has come to pass
  quickly, and today only Lakshmana... [3-2-18b-19a]


 "She who is a foresighted lady, she who is not happy with the kingdom for her son,
  she by whom I, a dear one to all beings, am sent to forests, and she is my middle mother, her
  desire is fulfilled today, nay now itself... [3-2-19b-20]


 "To me, oh, Soumitri, the grief of others touching Seetha is more, than father's
  demise or grabbing away my kingdom... [3-2-21]


 When said thus by Rama, Lakshmana said this with flooding tears of lament, and in
  his anger hissing like a forestalled snake. [3-2-22]


 "Oh, Rama, you being the Indra like lord of all beings, and while you are being
  attended by an adherent like me, what for you worry yourself like a derelict? [3-2-23]


 "He will now be felled with my arrow as I am enraged at him, and gone are his
  lives now, and indeed the earth shall drink his blood... [3-2-24]


 "Indeed, that which anger was there to me on Bharata when he desired kingdom, that
  anger I will now release on Viradha, as Indra released his Thunderbolt on the mountain...
  [3-2-25]


 "Accelerated by my shoulder strength this ruinous arrow shall fall on his massive
  chest, thus life from his body shall decamp, and then he shall whirlingly fall onto the earth..."
  So said Lakshmana. [3-2-26]

The forest
  Dandaka Forest wherein Rama is trekking is a dominion of their kingdom, but a deserted forest.
  One named Danda, the last son of Ikshvaku, was performing all demonic activities in their
  kingdom. His father Ikshvaku received many a complaint about Danda's deeds from his subjects, and
  angered at his erring son Danda and banishes him from the kingdom.

Danda took refuge
  in Vindhya mountain range and built a kingdom and a beautiful capital for himself called
  Madhumanta. He rubbed shoulders with all the demons thereabout and thus became a disciple of Sage
  Shukraachaarya, the guru of demons. One day when Sage Shukraachaarya is not in hermitage, Danda
  reaches there, and sees Araja, the elder daughter of the sage Shukra, and molests her, in spite
  of her repeated protests. Later when Sage Shukraachaarya comes to know about it, gets enraged and
  curses Danda, to fall down along with his entire kingdom under a mud storm around that Madhumanta
  capital for a period of seven consecutive days.

Then there is a
  mud storm for seven days and entire kingdom went under mud, later to become a forest called
  Dandaka. The place to where the curse fearing people fled from that Madhunata to further south is
  called Jansthaana. At later time, when Rama's peregrination started, these two places, Dandaka
  forest and Janasthaana, are under the domain of Ravana, and Ravana made one demon named Khara, as
  the protector of this dominion Jansthaana.

This is the place
  where Rama built his hermitage Panchavati, at which Demoness Surpanakha arrives, and from where
  Ravana abducts Seetha. When Rama asks the forest dwelling sages for a quiet place to live on, the
  sages in Dandaka forest, will make Rama constantly move southward, till he reaches Janasthana,
  indirectly directing Rama to eradicate the demonic influence over these places, which once
  belonged to Rama's kingdom.

But when Khara is about to lunge to the forefront of Rama, nearing him the commander of demonic forces 
named Trishira spoke this to him. [3-27-1]


"Desisting from your personal adventure you enjoin me for I am an invader, and then you are certain 
to see me felling that mighty-armed Rama in combat. [3-27-2]


"Taking oath on my weapon I promise to you that I truly wish to kill this Rama, as he deserves ill of 
all the demons by killing. [3-27-3]


"Hold back your combative-adventurism and become an examiner to decide whether I am going to become 
his god of death in this combat, or he becomes mine. [3-27-4]


"If I were to kill Rama you may gladly proceed to Janasthaana, else if Rama kills me then you can adventurously 
proceed against him for a combat." Thus Trishira spoke to Khara. [3-27-5]


By that death-greedy demon Trishira, Khara is manoeuvred and Khara to him said 'begone... combat...' 
and thus permitted, Trishira proceeded to the forefront of Rama. [3-27-6]


Trishira with a lustrous chariot that is yoked with equally lustrous horses hurried towards Rama in 
that war, like a tri-peaked mountain, for they say, he is a tri-headed demon. [3-27-7]


Discharging hosts of arrow-torrents like a hefty-arrow-cloud, he readily discharged a noise similar 
to the thudding drumbeat when a water-wet war-drum is beaten, rather than a blast from a heated drum. 
[3-27-8]


On seeing the oncoming of that demon Trishira, Raghava welcomed him by speedily winnowing smarting arrows 
from his bow. [3-27-9]


That grave and tumultuous encounter chanced between Rama and Trishira is like the extremely forceful 
encounter between a loin and an elephant. [3-27-10]


Later when Trishira smote on the forehead of highly enraged Rama with three arrows, Rama's ire is intensified 
and he franticly said this to that demon. [3-27-11]


"Oho! What an energy of a triumphing adventurer is this! A demon with this sort of energy is adventuring 
me, whose arrows rap my forehead peripherally, like flowers! [3-27-12]


"Now you accept arrows plunging from the string of my bow..." saying thus, that infuriated Rama with 
his alacritous swiftness hit the chest of Trishira with fourteen arrows similar to venomous snakes. 
[3-27-13, 14a]


With four of his straight shooting arrows that have hook-like barbs, that resplendent Rama hewed down 
four of the speedy horses of Trishira's chariot. [3-27-14b, 15a]


With eight arrows Rama felled the charioteer from his settle on the chariot, and with one arrow ripped 
off the high flying flag on that chariot. [3-27-15b, 16a]


When that nightwalker is vaulting from that smashed chariot Rama with his arrows tore his chest to shreds 
and he that Trishira became inert. [3-27-16b, 17a]


And with three sharp and rapid arrows, and even with his own exasperation, Rama of inestimable aptitude 
rolled the three heads that demon. [3-27-17b, 18a]


When that nightwalker is highly tortured with Rama's arrows he collapsed spewing blood with fumes, whereat 
he is standing in war, at where his three heads rolled just now. [3-27-18b, 19a]


As with the fleeing of deer alarmed by a tiger, the demons remaining after liquidation, whom Khara has 
protected so far and whose confidence is now shattered, are running away, and they gave Khara the run-around. 
[3-27-19b, 20a]


On seeing at those deserters Khara is piqued and quickly brought them back to his control, and then 
as with the scampering of eclipsing planet Rahu towards moon during lunar-eclipse, he scurried towards 
Rama alone. [3-27-20b, c]

On seeing dreary Lakshmana coming into the void of forest devoid of Vaidehi, then the virtue-souled 
Rama, the son of Dasharatha, has asked him impatiently. [3-58-1]


"She who has come in tow with me to Dandaka forest when I started for peregrination, whom you have now 
deserted and came here, oh, Lakshmana, she that Vaidehi, where is she? [3-58-2]


"When I have become forlorn with the forfeiture of my kingdom and when I was rushing for Dandaka forest 
she stood with me as a partaker in my woes. She that comely Vaidehi, where is she? [3-58-3]


"Without whom I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, valiant one, such a Seetha who in simile 
is like the daughter of deities and who is my life-force, where is she? [3-58-4]


"I am unambitious for the rulership either on heavens or on the earth, oh, Lakshmana, without the daughter 
of Janaka whose aspect glisters like gold. [3-58-5]


"Vaidehi who is dearer to me than my lives, will she be alive somehow! Oh, valiant Lakshmana, this peregrination 
of mine, will it not become futile, someway! [3-58-6]


"When I am dead for the sake of Seetha and when you get back to Ayodhya lonesomely, and when Kaikeyi's 
wishes are accomplished thus, oh, Soumitri, will she be comfortable, somewhat! [3-58-7]


"Kaikeyi is with her son, with a kingdom, and further her 'purposes are achieved,' oh, gentle Lakshmana, 
and because of the death of her son will my austerely mother Kausalya humbly get into the servitude 
of Kaikeyi, anyhow! [3-58-8]


"I wish to get at the hermitage again if only that Vaidehi of good-conduct is alive in hermitage, else, 
oh, Lakshmana, if death has already conducted her out of hermitage I too will give up my lives here 
itself. [3-58-9]


"If Seetha, the princess from Videha, does not chat with me as before smiling gleefully on my arrival 
at the hermitage, oh, Lakshmana, I really breath my last. [3-58-10]


"Say Lakshmana, whether that pietistic Vaidehi is alive or not? Or, on your becoming unmindful of your 
guard is she consumed by demons, either? [3-58-11]


"She who is softish by her nature and youngish by her age has never noticed the despair of separation 
from me, and now by my dissociation she will be despairing brokenheartedly, so it seems. [3-58-12]


"That impostor and highly impudent demon Maareecha who shouted loudly as, 'oh, Lakshmana,' might have 
caused fear even in you in everyway. [3-58-13]


"I hope that Vaidehi has also heard that voice which is similar to that of mine, and I hope frightened 
as she is she might have also hastened you, and I hope you also have come to see me, that hastily! [3-58-14]


"In everyway you have caused hardship by leaving Seetha in isolation, and a leeway is given to the diabolical 
demons for a counterattack against us. [3-58-15]


"Raw-flesh eating demons are distraught as I have liquidated Khara, as a result those ghastly ones would 
have liquidated Seetha by now. There is no doubt about it. [3-58-16]


"In everyway I am sunken in scourge, but oh, enemy-eliminator Lakshmana, what I can possibly do in present 
situation? Perchance, this sort of scourge is liable to chance upon me, alas!" Thus Rama gave vent to 
his feelings on his way to hermitage. [3-58-17]


In this way while thinking emotively about that curvaceous Seetha, Raghava hurriedly returned to Janasthaana 
along with Lakshmana. [3-58-18]


He that Rama who chastened his younger brother en route is worried in aspect and wizened is his mouth 
by hunger, by strain, and also thus by thirst, and suspiring heavily he arrived near at hermitage, and 
became dispirited when he beheld the hermitage in vacuity. That valiant Rama on quickly entering his 
own hermitage found it to be vacuous. Then he rushed out and went round a place of pastime of Seetha, 
saying 'yes, this is that place where she used to move round for plucking flowers.' And again he dashed 
in to hermitage only to find it as an empty cottage. Then he rushed out to some other place of playtime 
of Seetha yelling, 'yes, this is that place where she used play with deer, squirrels and birds.' And 
again came back to vacant hermitage, and again he dashed to some other prayer-time place exclaiming, 
'yes, this is that very place where she offered her daily prayers.' Finally on returning to the vacant 
hermitage he became one who is plunged into hair-raising throes of despair as that cottage is emptied 
of Seetha. [3-58-19, 20]

Thus when Shuurpanakha disparaged that valiant Khara amidst demons he is infuriated and spoke these 
highly hurtful words. [3-22-1]


"This fury of mine originating from the disgrace brought on you is like the highly bitter salt water 
that is impossible to contain when ingested. [3-22-2]


"I do not care the valour of that Rama for he is a human with dwindled lifetime, now going to give up 
his life slain by his own misdoings. [3-22-3]


"Control your tears and cast off your despair too, for I will send Rama to the abode of the Terminator 
along with his brother. [3-22-4]


"Now, you demoness, you will swill that Rama's red hot blood when that short-lived one is hewed down 
to earth with an axe." So Khara assured Shuurpanakha. [3-22-5]


On hearing the words plunged from the mouth of Khara she is very much gladdened and in all her stupidity 
she further praised her brother highly saying, "you are the best among all the demons..." [3-22-6]


Though she denounced him earlier she alone praised him now for which Khara is overjoyed, and then he 
ordered his army commander, namely Duushana. [3-22-7]


"Those who are the followers of my will, whose hustle will be frightful and who will be unretreating 
in combats, such of those demons are there in fourteen thousand numbers, aren't they. [3-22-8]


"And oh, gentle Duushana, those domineering demons are with dark-clouds like complexions, and they are 
the pamperers of genocide, as such, cause them for a belligerency, all at once. [3-22-9]


"For me, oh, gentle one, promptly position my chariot before me along with bows and arrows, amazing 
swords and diverse sharp power bolts. [3-22-10]


"Oh, war pert Duushana, I wish to start ahead of all the demons of ours, who are the clans-demons of 
the great souled Paulastya, for the purpose of elimination of that evil-minded Rama." So said Khara 
to Duushana. [3-22-11]


While Khara is saying thus Duushana heralded saying, "Here comes the great chariot with sun's dazzle, 
yoked with very good horses of variegated colours." [3-22-12]


That chariot which has a roomy cabin with its rooftop like that of the ridge of Mt. Meru, body embellished 
in gold, wheels golden, gem-studded yoke-to-carriage shaft, all around encompassed with golden artefacts 
like fishes, flowers, trees, mountains, sun, moon, and auspicious birds flocks and stars, and even decorated 
with jingle-bells, endowed with flags, swords, and best horses, and such as it is, Khara embarked on 
it with all his rancour. [3-22-13, 14, 15]


On overseeing that great army with chariots, skins shields, weaponry and flags, and even at Duushana 
too, Khara charged all those demons saying "proceed." [3-22-16]


Then that demonic force with their ghoulish skin shields, weaponry and flags, issued forth from Janasthaana, 
blaring blatantly and foraying dashingly. [3-22-17]


Wielding maces, dart-bolts, and spears, and also razor-sharp axes, swords and discs, and dreadful power-darts 
and power-bolts that are flashing, iron maces, unusual bows, clubs, scimitars and pounding-shafts, and 
even thunderbolt like weapons that are calamitous in look, that army which comprises fourteen thousand 
fiendish demons that are the followers of Khara's whim, has started from Janasthaana. [3-22-18, 19, 
20]


On seeing the outrush of those demons of diabolic appearance, then Khara's chariot also proceeded a 
little later at their behind. [3-22-21]


Then the charioteer set spurs on those colourful horses that are adorned in polished gold according 
to the notions of Khara. [3-22-22]


When the chariot of enemy destroyer Khara is driven that impetuously, it has started to swell earth's 
four cardinal quarters and inter-quarters with turbulence. [3-22-23]


He whose voice is thunderous and whose rancour escalated speedily, and who is hastening forward like 
the Terminator intending to destroy his enemy, that Khara repeatedly hurried the charioteer shouting 
at him loudly like a overwhelming cloud that is going to storm stones. [3-22-24]

Then in his turn that demon Viradha said this sentence filling the forest with his gruesome voice, "I am asking you, really... 
tell me who you are and whereto you wish to go? " [3-3-1]


Then that highly resplendent Rama said about his Ikshvaku dynasty to the blazing faced demon who is insistent. [3-3-2]


"Know us as Kshatriya-s with ennobled bearing, and we are trekking the forest...but we wish to know about you, who are you 
that move about in Dandaka forest? [3-3-3]


Viradha said to that truly valiant Rama, "Ah! I'll tell you, oh king, be informed of me, oh Raghava... [3-3-4]


"I am the son of Java indeed... my mother is Shatahradaa, and all the demons on earth call me Viradha...'[3-3-5]


"On my undertaking ascesis I derived a boon from the beneficence of Brahma, by which I will neither be cut, nor slit, nor 
killed with a weapon in this world..."[3-3-6]


"Leave off this lady without any yearning for her, and you expeditiously flee-away as you have come, then your lives will 
not be snatched away... [3-3-7]


Rama in reply said this to that ogre Viradha, whose eyes are fully bloodshot in anger, who is monstrous in his body, and 
evil in intent... [3-3-8]


"You knave, fie upon you... you are in quest of you own death for your meanly measures, and definitely you will get it in 
this confrontation. Stay! I will not let you to live... [3-3-9]


Then, stringing his bow Rama indeed darted very sharp arrows, very quickly and well aiming the demon... [3-3-10]


Indeed seven arrows are let off with perfectly stringed bow, which have golden vanes, and very fast ones that equal the 
flights of Garuda, the Divine Eagle and the Air-god. [3-3-11]


But, they the arrows that are akin to infernos and dressed with peacock feathers as their fins, on piercing the body of 
Viradha they fell onto the ground besmirched with blood. [3-3-12]


When that demon is thus struck, then he placed Vaidehi down from his arms, hauled up his spear, and very angrily rushed 
towards Rama and Lakshmana. [3-3-13]


And holding fast his spear that is similar to the Indra's Flagstaff he blaringly yelled a ghastly shriek, and thus he shone 
forth like the wide-mouthed Death, ready-to-gulp. [3-3-14]


Then with an effulgent arrow-rain those two brothers incessantly rained on demon Viradha, who is similar to the terminator 
of lifetime. [3-3-15]


He that highly horrendous demon laughed at that arrow-shower, and standing for a while he yawned, and on his yawning and 
stretching his limbs in fatigue those arrows that earlier have gone speedily, spilled out from his body that speedily. [3-3-16]


Demon Viradha held back his lives by the touch of boon, and raising up the spear he ran quickly at Rama and Lakshmana. [3-3-17]


The best wielder of weaponry Rama ripped that spear apart, which is akin to the Thunderbolt of Indra, and that which is 
like a blaze in the sky, with two arrows in the sky itself. [3-3-18]


Shattered by Rama's blazing shafts that spear fallen on ground like the boulder mass of Mt. Meru when it is shattered by 
Indra's Thunderbolt. [3-3-19]


They quickly upraised their swords and like a pair of up-swinging black-cobras they rapidly crashed on him, and then battered 
him mightily. [3-3-20]


He that demon thus beaten very firmly by Rama and Lakshmana, then on grabbing those unwavering ones and manly tigers with 
his arms, that furious demon wished to carry them away. [3-3-21]


Knowing the thinking of the demon for sure, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, "Let him easily carry us anywhere on his way... [3-3-22]


"Let this demon carry us as he wishes, and Saumitri, by which way this night-walker goes, that alone will be our way... 
[3-3-23]


But he that night-walker arrogant as he is by his might has uplifted Rama and Lakshmana like babies by that might and courage 
alone, and placed them on his shoulders as one would place babies. [3-3-24]


That nightwalker Viradha on placing those two Raghava-s on his shoulders gone towards deeper forest yelling very luridly. 
[3-3-25]


That demon entered into a baffling forest that is like a very dark cloud in its sheen, where a variety of massive trees 
are contained in, numerous flocks of vulturine birds are overspreading, and where wild jackals and other predaceous animals 
are sprawling around, along with Rama and Lakshmana. [3-3-26]

On seeing Shuurpanakha who came back only to wreck havoc on demonic race and again fell before him as 
before, Khara spoke this sentence to her in clear terms in all his fury. [3-21-1]


"What for your are howling again when I have just now commanded those fearless flesh eating demons in 
order to fulfill your wish? [3-21-2]


"Those demons are my admirers, adherers and they always remained my well-wishers, hence there is no 
question of their non-accomplishment of my orders. [3-21-3]


"Owing to what you are highly bawling by saying, 'haa, lord' and wriggle on the ground like a snake? 
I would like to know the reason for all this, what is it? [3-21-4]


"I am here to take care of you, then why should you really cry out like an uncared-for being, get up...get 
up, and ward off this sort of perplexity." Thus Khara said to Shuurpanakha. [3-21-5]


She that Shuurpanakha who is otherwise an unassuageable one is wholly pacified when Khara spoke to her 
thus that way, and she on dabbing her tearful eyes then spoke to her brother Khara. [3-21-6]


"I came to you just a while back with my ears and nose chopped off and wet with gushes of blood, and 
you too have comforted me, isn't it. [3-21-7]


"Oh, valiant brother, for my delight you too have sent fourteen demons to eliminate that atrocious Rama 
along with Lakshmana, isn't it? [3-21-8]


"But they all who handled their spears and bolts along with an envious anger are killed in a fight with 
Rama by his arrows that cleave the crucial parts of his opponents. [3-21-9]


"On seeing those highly impetuous demons falling to earth in a trice, and even on seeing the unusual 
deed of Rama in felling them, I am highly alarmed. [3-21-10]


"Oh me! I am alarmed, fully frenzied, and even despaired, oh, nightwalker Khara, and beholding dread 
everywhere again I have come seeking your refuge. [3-21-11]


"Why do not you rescue me when I am drowned in a vast ocean called grief, wherein each pervasive crocodile 
is despair and each swelling wave is fright. [3-21-12]


"Besides, those flesh-eating demons that have followed me are also felled by Rama with his sharp arrows, 
for whom I have a contrite heart. [3-21-13]


"If you have mercy on me, and even on those dead demons, and if ability and animation are still left 
in you to cope with Rama, oh, nightwalker, kill that Rama who is a thorn in the side of demons dwelling 
in Dandaka forest. [3-21-14, 15a]


"If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, I will give up my life unhesitatingly, 
that too in your fore, that too now itself.


If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, now itself I will give up my life 
than living a shameless life with these lopped ears and nose. [3-21-15b, 16a]


"I can perceive instinctually that you are incapable of affronting Rama in a given crucial battle, even 
if your are with all your forces on the battlefield, and you assert yourself a valiant, but you are 
just vainglorious. [3-21-16b, 17]


"Kill those two, Rama and Lakshmana, as they are just humans, or else, if you are incapable of doing 
so, really what for is your stay here in Janasthaana with your trivial stamina and trifling sinews like 
a stupid blemishing his clan, then get out of this Janasthaana at once along with your hench-demons. 
[3-21-18, 19]


"You will completely and quickly evanish, indeed, subjugated by resplendence of Rama, for that Dasharatha's 
son Rama possess that kind of resplendence, in effect. [3-21-20]


"And, by whom I am misshapen that brother of Rama too is a highly vigorous one..." in this way on saying 
Shuurpanakha bawled variously in the presence of her brother, Khara, and then anguished by her own affliction 
that demoness with a cave like belly started hitting her paunch with both of her hands, and what is 
more, she swooned. [3-21-21, 22]

In not seeing Seetha that virtue-souled Rama's sagacity is marred by his anguish and
he bewailed with his lotus-like eyes that are reddening like a pair of lotuses, raising is long
arms. [3-62-1]


Even if Raghava is not able to see Seetha in his presence he started talking to her
in a kind of inarticulate wailing, as wailing pampered his articulacy because his speech took
shelter of wailing instinct, and as he is cowed down by Love-god, and thus he started to vent out
his heart in this way. [3-62-2]


"Flowers fascinate you very much, my dear, hence you veil yourself with the full
bloomed branches of Ashoka tree, but that alone is amplifying my anguish because you both have
presently became tormentors. [3-62-3]


"Maybe, both your thighs liken to the stalks of banana plants, thinking so, now you
have lapped them in grovy banana plants, but I can distinguish which is which, thus now I caught
sight of them, oh, lady, you are inapt at least to cover them from me. [3-62-4]


"Oh, lady, you are facetiously glorying in the boscage of fully bloomed Karnikaara
trees which is really wafting worry to me, rather than the fragrance of those flowers oh, glorious
lady, enough, enough is this facetiousness of yours. [3-62-5]


"I am aware of your humour, lady, and I know that you are jocose, but in a place
like hermitage unmerited is this sort of raillery, even if it is good-natured. Hence, you come
back, oh, wide-eyed one, your cottage is empty. [3-62-6, 7a]


"Oh, Lakshmana, very evidently demons have either gorged up Seetha, or perhaps
abducted her, because she is not returning to me who am whiny indeed for her. [3-62-7b, 8a]


"Indeed these teary-eyed mobs of deer look as if to explain that nightwalkers have
gluttonised my lady. [3-62-8b, 9a]


"Ha! My graceful lady, to where you have strayed now... Ha! Chastely and best
complexioned lady, now the ambition of my queen mother Kaikeyi will be fulfilled, as I breath my
last owing to your straying... [3-62-8b, 9a]


"I have come to forests with Seetha and have to go back to Ayodhya without Seetha.
How, in all but name, can I step into an oblivion called my palace-chambers? [3-62-9b, 10a]


"People will denounce me as a vigourless and pitiless person, and my ineptitude will
indeed be self-evident, for Seetha is led away from me by some tactical being... [3-62-10b,
11a]


"When the king of Mithila Janaka asks after the wellbeing of all the three of us
after the completion of forest living, how do I have the face to stand him? [3-62-11b, 12a]


"On seeing me without Seetha the king of Videha will be distraught by the perishing
of his daughter, and he defiantly goes under the preponderance of perplexity... [3-62-12b, 13a]


"Instead, I prefer not to go to the city Ayodhya that is ruled by Bharata, because
it must be comforting to one and all under his rulership, but not to me as Seetha will not be with
me... else if, that end of my life occurs now and if I were to go to heaven, even that heaven will
be a void to me without her... I believe so... [3-62-13b, 14a]


"Hence, Lakshmana, you go back to that auspicious city Ayodhya forsaking me in
forests, because I have no existence without Seetha, isn't it! [3-62-14b, 15a]


"On tightly hugging Bharata you shall tell him these words as I have said, 'Rama
authorises you to reign the earth...' [3-62-16]


"Oh, efficacious Lakshmana, on revering my mothers Kaika, Sumitra, and Kausalya
justifiably you tell them my good bye, and you as the one who effectuates whatever is assigned to
you, you have to effortfully protect my mother Kausalya by doing whatever she says. [3-62-17b,
18]


"Oh, the subjugator of unfriendly, Lakshmana... you shall clearly inform in detail
about this perish of Seetha, also that of mine, to our mothers. [3-62-19]


Thus Raghava, the dejected, neared every corner of the forest in his search, and
bewailed because that lady with best plaits, Seetha, is not found and missing from him. Even
Lakshmana became whey-faced, frantic-hearted, highly overwrought, by the fear of uncertainty
looming large on them. [3-62-20]

When Ravana perversely ordered that way in all his kingliness, Maareecha spoke these
words caustically and frankly to that king of demons. [3-41-1]


"Oh, night-walker, by which evildoer this thought, which is self-ruinous to you,
along with your progeny, kingdom and ministers put together, is taught to you? [3-41-2]


"Who is that reprobate unhappy with such a happy one like you, and oh, king, by whom
this door of demise is ingeniously shown to you? [3-41-3]


"It is very clear, oh, night-walker, that your rivals with skimpy might are aspiring
that you should be completely ruined coming into conflict with more mighty Rama. [3-41-4]


"He who wishes you to get ruined by your undertaking a self-made destruction is a
scoundrel with a pernicious intent, as such, by whom you are counselled to do this? [3-41-5]


"Your ministers are not curbing you anywise when you scramble on a high road to
self-ruination, hence they are indeed to be sentenced to death, but they are not being executed for
their dereliction. [3-41-6]


"Veracious ministers have to restrain a self-willed king when he relies on a
wrong-route, isn't it. But you are unrestrained by your ministers though you are self-willed and
though you are taking a wrong-route. [3-41-7]


"Oh, best conqueror Ravana, probity, prosperity and pleasures, and even the
popularity of the ministers, oh, night-walker, are achieved at the beneficence of their master.
[3-41-8]


"Contrariwise, oh, Ravana, all that beneficence of the king to ministers becomes
futile when the king behaves perversely, and even the others, namely the subjects of kingdom, will
derive distress by the negative virtue of their master. [3-41-9]


"The king alone is the root cause for probity and prosperity, isn't it. Therefore,
oh, best prosperous one, in all situations the kings are to be safeguarded from the ill effects of
influences. [3-41-10]


"It is impossible to govern kingdom, oh, demon, the night-walker, for a king with
acridity, with hostility, or with immorality. [3-41-11]


"The ministers with drastic notions will indeed fall apart together with their king,
like a chariot that gets ramshackled together with it charioteer on a rough road, though it is
hieing with galloping horses but badly controlled by that slothful charioteer. [3-41-12]


"In the world many saintly beings that are high-minded and pursuers of ethicality
are completely ruined together with their kinsmen owing to the misdeeds of others. [3-41-13]


"Oh, Ravana, the subjects do not flourish while a lord with contrariety and
coerciveness safeguards them, just like goats guarded by a fox. [3-41-14]


"All those demons will definitely ruin, oh, Ravana, to whom you are the acrimonious
and malicious king with unconquered senses, though you have conquered the heaven. [3-41-15]


"What is the use of laming for myself as I foregathered this ghastly situation as in
crow-palm-tree syndrome, but in this issue you alone are regrettable, for you are gong to
completely ruin along with your military. [3-41-16]


"That Rama will soon kill you after killing me, and I will be dying at the hand of
my enemy rather than at the hand of my own clansman like you, whereby the purpose of my life will
be brought to an end. [3-41-17]


"Know that I am killed just when Rama notices me, and know that you are also killed
along with your kinsmen just when you steal Seetha. [3-41-18]


"If you are going to bring Seetha from their hermitage on going there with me, then
you will not be there, I will not be there, Lanka will not be there, the demons will not be there.
[3-41-19]


"As a desirer of your welfare I am dissuading you, oh, night-walker, but you may
feel that this word of mine is unpleasant to you. People on diminishing lifetime will be similar to
corpses and a corpse cannot take in the expedient spoken by considerate confidants, isn't so.

Then on arriving at Raghava's hermitage that ghastly Shuurpanakha has shown the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, 
along with Seetha to the fourteen demons. [3-20-1]


They have seen the great-mighty Rama seated in the thatched cottage along with Seetha and Lakshmana 
attending to him. [3-20-2]


On seeing the arrival of the demons, and the demoness Shuurpanakha too, that magnificent Rama of Raghava 
dynasty said to the radiantly brilliant Lakshmana. [3-20-3]


"Oh, Soumitri, briefly tarry at the close of Seetha as I wish to eliminate these demons who have trailed 
the path of that demoness to here. [3-20-4]


On hearing that word of Rama, then the nimble-souled Lakshmana honoured the word of Rama saying "so 
be it." [3-20-5]


On taking up his awful bow that is decorated with gold Raghava stringed it with bowstring and even spoke 
the demons as a forewarning. [3-20-6]


"We the sons of Dasharatha are brothers named Rama and Lakshmana, and we entered the impenetrable forests 
Dandaka along with Seetha. [3-20-7]


"We the dispassionate subsist on fruits and tubers treading in the path of virtue, and we being the 
sages resident in Dandaka forest what for you outrage us. [3-20-8]


"As assigned by the sages I chanced here with bow and arrows to decimate you evil-souled and unrighteous 
beings in a crucial clash. [3-20-9]


"Stay there obligingly or you should not be able to return, else if you desire your lives, oh, nightwalkers, 
you may return now. [3-20-10]


On hearing that sentence of Rama they the fourteen ghoulish demons who are the slayers of Brahmans and 
handlers of spears have become highly infuriated, and they with their bloodshot eyes and with harsh 
words said these words to Rama, whose eyes are with blood streaks at their ends, and who also is a sweet 
talker, and whose valour is yet unseen by those fourteen demons. [3-20-11, 12]


"Killed in conflict by us you alone will set your lives loose as an inciter of fury in our highly great 
souled lord Khara. [3-20-13]


"Indeed, what capability you have as a lone one to stand against many of us in the forefront of war, 
and why tell again about your battling ability in a given battle. [3-20-14]


"When we launch maces, spears and swords by our might you will forgo your lives, mettle, and even the 
bow now clasped in your hand." So said the demons to Rama. [3-20-15]


su mahaatmanaH oh, Supreme Person; bhartR^iH kharasya 
our lord, to Khara; krodham utpaadya anger, infusing; asmaabhiH hataH tvam praaNaan na 
haasyase eva by us, killed, you, Spirits, not, leaves, thus...


"Oh! Supreme Person, we have come here because you incited anger 
in our lord Khara, and by us killed will you let go your lives, mettle and spirits? No. Never it will 
happen."


The reason for not happening of that event is explained: raNa 
muurdhan in war's, van; ekasya te agrataH sthaatum lone one, you, before, to stand;
bahuunaam asmaakam api many, we are, though; kaa shaktiH where is, capability for 
us


"Though you are a lone being, and we are many, where is the capability 
for us to stand before you in the van of war?"


Thus they say that they have come only at the behest of their 
lord but not to kill Rama. baahuH yuktaiH parighaiH shuula paTTisaiH upalakshitaanaam though 
equipped with our paraphernalia like maces, spears, swords etc., adhyaahaara: asmaakam our;
praaNaan viiryam tyakshasi lives, vitality, we loose; ehi come... give us salvation.


"Though we are equipped with much paraphernalia like maces, spears, 
swords etc., we lose our lives and vitality at your hand, so come on, take them away, and accord salvation 
and release from our curse. It is better to die at your hand than returning to Khara and dying a merciless 
death at the hand of Khara.


It may be remembered that these fourteen are the cursed Vedic-scholarly 
disciples of Chandrakanta, now in an accursed form namely Khara and other demons. Maheshvara Tiirtha.


Thus saying that way clamorously they the fourteen demons, upraising their weapons they unhesitatingly 
rushed towards Rama alone, and they hurled lances towards that unconquerable Raghava. [3-20-16, 17a]


Rama in turn shredded all of those fourteen lances only with as many arrows that are adorned in gold. 
[3-20-17b, 18a]


Next that great resplendent Rama in high wrath took up fourteen iron bolt like arrows that are whetted 
on whetstone and equalling the sun in their dazzle. [3-20-18b, 19a]


Then Raghava took up his bow, arched it, and aiming at the targeted demons released arrows as Indra 
would release his Thunderbolts. [3-20-19b, 20a]


And by the force of their speed those arrows gored the chests of those demons, and then on coming out 
bedaubed with blood they swiftly penetrated into earth like snakes into snake pit. [3-20-20b, 21a]


Those arrows bursting their hearts they are blood bathed, mangled, and utterly dead, and like the uprooted 
trees they fell onto the ground. [3-20-21b, 22a]


On seeing the demons falling onto ground that demoness Shuurpanakha is convulsed in rage, and she with 
a blanched aspect returned to the near of Khara in an agonising manner like a creeper exuding resin 
on incision, and fell before him as before. [3-20-22b, 23]


Then she in the presence of her brother Khara discharged a great outcry, and with a bloodless face she 
spilled tears attuning the strains of a whiner. [3-20-24]


Shuurpanakha having seen the fall of demons quickly fled from Panchavati of Rama to trikanTaka, the 
capital of Khara, and she being the sister of Khara she reported to Khara all about the destruction 
of those demons, in its entirety. [3-20-25]

" I am delighted Rama, safe you be, oh Lakshmana, well-contended I am for you have
come to pay respects to me along with Seetha. [3-13-1]


"The well-worn trail of yours on pathway is strenuousness and painful for you two,
and it is evident from the sweat above your necks, even much more for Janaka's daughter, Maithili.
[3-13-2]


"She is delicate and not discomforted by such distresses earlier, yet motivated by
her friendship she came to these highly detrimental forests. [3-13-3]


<em>"In which way Seetha takes delight in these forests, Rama, that you may ensure
to her, for she has done an impossible deed in following you to forests, an impossible deed for
womenfolk, in general. [3-13-4]</em>


"From the beginning of creation the nature of women is this way only, oh scion of
Raghu, they devote themselves to their men in good fortune, but they leave them off in ill fortune.
[3-13-5]


<em>"With the mercuriality of hundreds of streaks of thunderbolt and with the
incisiveness of a weapon, and with the speediness of an eagle or the gusty wind, the women are
conformable. [3-13-6]</em>


"But she this wife of yours is devoid of all those stigmas, an exemplary and an
estimable lady, like Lady Arundhati. [3-13-7]


"Where you wish to put up along with Lakshmana and with this Seetha, oh,
enemy-destroyer Rama, that province shall be glorified." So said Sage Agastya to Rama."
[3-13-8]


Thus said by the sage, Raghava spoke amiable this sentence adjoining his palms to
the sage who is glowing like a ritual-fire. [3-13-9]


"I am privileged and blessed as my mentor and the eminent age is well pleased with
the virtues of my brother and wife which are non-dissimilar to mine. [3-13-10]


<em>"But a place with water and many forests may please be shown, where I can reside
happily and self-composedly on erecting a hermitage." Thus Rama asked the Sage Agastya.
[3-13-11]</em>


Then that eminent sage Agastya on contemplating a while about what Rama has said,
that virtuous and confident sage spoke more ideational word to Rama. [3-13-12]


"A most prosperous place called Panchavati is there at a distance of two yojana-s
from here, oh, dear Rama, which is abundant with tubers, fruits, water, and many deer." Thus
Agastya started to tell. [3-13-13]


<em>"On your going there along with Saumitri, and on erecting a hermitage you may
take delight in there complying the decreed order of your father. [3-13-14]</em>


<em>"Indeed all of this episode of yours is known to me, oh, merited one, by the
ability of my asceticism, and also by my friendship with Dasharatha. [3-13-15]</em>


"I am in the know of your heartfelt certitude by my ascesis, thereby I wish to
advise you to go to Panchavati, though I said that you may dwell in these ascetic-woods along with
me. [3-13-16, 17a]


"That woodland will be delightful, isn't it Raghava, for it is praiseworthy and not
very far off from here, and Seetha can take delight in there. [3-13-17b, 18a]


"There Maithili will take delight nearby River Godavari, and it is with abundant
tubers, fruits, various are its bird flocks, and it is very reclusive too, oh, great dextrous Rama,
further it is meritorious and appealing. [3-13-18b, 19]


"Even you, Rama, with your good deportment are capable to safeguard the hermits
while residing there. [3-13-20]


"Oh, brave one, you see this great forest of flower-liquor trees, you have to
proceed north of it and advance towards a banyan tree. [3-13-21]


"Then on climbing up an upland a mountain is seen, that which is also not far away,
and that renowned Panchavati is there in an ever-blooming forest in the valley of that mountain."
Said Sage Agastya to Rama. [3-13-22]


When thus said by Sage Agastya, Rama along with Soumitri venerated and bade farewell
to that truth advocator sage Agastya. [3-13-23]


Thus well bidden by Sage Agastya those two Rama and Lakshmana have offered their
venerations at the feet of that sage and proceeded to their prospective hermitage at Panchavati
along with Seetha. [3-12-24]


Those princes that are dauntless in war took up their bows and braced up their
quivers, and resolutely proceeded to Panchavati on the route apprised by that great sage Agastya.

Rama on killing that demon Maareecha, who is a guise changer at his wish and who moved about in the 
guise of a deer, instantly started to return on the trail by which he trailed after that deer-demon. 
[3-57-1]


While Rama is anxiously hurrying to see Maithili, then a brutish voiced jackal deafeningly howled at 
his behind. [3-57-2]


On hearing that threatening and hair-raising howl of jackal Rama is overly threatened just by the tone 
of fox in which it is foreboding, inasmuch as the forbidding intoning of Maareecha. [3-57-3]


"Huh! As to how this jackal has howled I deem that as inauspicious. As yet undevoured by demons would 
Vaidehi be safe? [3-57-4]


"On knowing the nature of my voice Maareecha in the semblance of a deer yelled out mimicking my voice. 
If Lakshmana listens that voice, recognising it as my voice he will instantly rush to my near. Else 
if Maithili listens, she will hasten him to go over here and Soumitri instantly rushes here leaving 
her off. [3-57-5, 6]


"As could be seen from Maareecha's becoming a Golden Deer only to sidetrack and take me away from hermitage, 
his becoming a demon when hit with an arrow, and his shouting words indeed like, 'ha, Lakshmana, ha, 
Seetha, I am killed,' the demons are collectively intending to do away with Seetha. It is certain. [3-57-7, 
8]


"Whether there will be safety in forest for those two in my absence, or not, is my doubt. Owing to my 
devastating Janasthaana I have become a harboured grudge for demons, am not I! As such, foretokens are 
appearing now, severely and severally." Thus Rama's thoughts have sprinted. [3-57-9, 10a]


When that soulful Rama has heard the whistle of jackal while returning, he persistently thought in this 
way about his detour caused by demon in the disguise of a deer, thus he speedily advanced towards his 
hermitage. [3-57-10b, 11]


Raghava came to Janasthaana doubting overly, and the animals and birds of Janasthaana which look doleful 
have neared him whose heart has become doleful. [3-57-12]


Those doleful animals and birds moving in circumambulations from the left side to right of that noble-souled 
Rama they let off frightening shrieks, and then observing those highly forbidding foretokens Rama returned 
to his own hermitage hastily and hurriedly. [3-57-13]


Then Rama saw Lakshmana coming towards him with a lacklustre face, and then Lakshmana, who is melancholic 
and anguishing in his divergence from Seetha, met Rama not a long-way-off, where Rama is a similar partaker 
in melancholy and anguishing by way of his convergence upon ill-omens. [3-57-14, 15a]


On seeing Lakshmana who has arrived at this place leaving off Seetha in a forest that is desolate, more 
so an adorable forest for demons, Rama reproached him as his elder brother. [3-57-15b, 16a]


Taking Lakshmana's left hand into his, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, alike a bewailer spoke this brusque 
speech that has a mellowly fruition in future. [3-57-16b, 17a]


"You have done a deplorable deed in coming here forsaking Seetha. Now, oh, gentle Lakshmana, are we 
somewhat safe, or everything has already gone astray now itself, or what. [3-57-17b, 18a]


"Oh, brave one, according to these many inauspicious forebodings that have manifested themselves to 
me, we might have lost Janaka's daughter Seetha, or the forest ranging demons might have devoured her, 
or else they might have kidnapped her, I am doubtless about it. [3-57-18b, 19]


"Oh, tigerly-man Lakshmana, I wonder whether we can at least make out the daughter of Janaka Seetha 
in her intactness and aliveness. [3-57-20]


"On observing these mobs of deer, this jackal, also even these birds which are voicing noisily facing 
the direction lit by the sun, oh, great-mighty Lakshmana, can we presume that there will be safety to 
that princes Seetha? [3-57-21]


"This very demon in his likeness to a deer led me on and led me off distantly as I was indeed following 
him, and by an intense effort somehow he was killed, and when dying he transfigured into a demon. [3-57-22]


"Now even my heart is woeful and I am woebegone, my left eye is also fluttering erratically, oh, Lakshmana, 
no doubt Seetha is not there in hermitage, maybe she is whisked away, or, wiped out, or, wandering around 
on a wrong way. [3-57-23]

On taking bath Rama with Seetha and Soumitri, then went to his own hermitage from that bank of River 
Godavari. [3-17-1]


Nearing that hermitage Raghava along with Lakshmana performed early morning rituals and then reached 
the cottage. [3-17-2]


There Rama comfortably spent time while being adored by eminent sages when he is with them, and narrating 
many a narrative while sitting in hermitage along with Seetha and his brother Lakshmana, thus he shone 
forth like the moon when with Chitra constellation. [3-1-7-3, 4]


At one time when Rama is sitting in hermitage and heartily absorbed in telling narratives some demoness 
arrived at that place, fortuitously. [3-17-5]


She is but the sister of ten-faced demon Ravana, Shuurpanakha by her name and she has seen him on reaching 
the paradisiacal being like Rama. [3-17-6]


He whose face is radiant, arms lengthy, eyes large like lotus petals, stride like that of an elephant, 
wearing bunches of hair-tufts, delicate yet greatly vigorous, possessor of all kingly aspects, complexion 
deep-blue like blue lotus, similar to Love-god in brilliance and in simile to Indra, the demoness has 
seen such a Rama and became lovesick. [3-17-7, 8, 9a]


She that demoness who is facially unpleasant one with that pleasant faced one, pot bellied one with 
the slim-waisted one, wry-eyed one with the broad-eyed one, coppery-haired one with the neatly tressed 
one, ugly featured one with the charming featured one, brassy voiced one with the gentle voiced one, 
deplorably oldish one with the youngish one, crooked talker with the pleasant talker, ill-mannered one 
with the well-mannered one, uncouth one with couth, abominable one with amiable Rama spoke, besieged 
by Love-god. [3-17-9b, 11, 12a]


"You are an ascetic yet with a wife, handling bow and arrows yet in the appearance of a sage  what for 
you have come to this province frequented by demons  it will be apt of you to tell the purpose of your 
coming here, in actuality " [3-17-12b, 13]


Thus asked by demoness Shuurpanakha that enemy-scorcher Rama started to inform all about it, straightforwardly. 
[3-17-14]


"A king named Dasharatha was there with his godlike valour, I am his eldest son, and people hear of 
me by name Rama. [3-17-15]


"He is Lakshmana by his name, my younger brother and a devoted follower of mine, and she is my wife, 
daughter of Videha's king, well-known as Seetha. [3-17-16]


"Desiring to implement the probity in following father's orders and for the sake of establishing probity 
in living an ascetic's life I have come here to forests to dwell, as enjoined by the directives of the 
king and my father, and by my mother, as well. [3-17-17]


"I too wish to know about you. Whose wife are you? What is your name? Or, whose daughter are you? By 
the way, you are with a most enthralling personality, and then you must be a demoness. [3-17-18]


"What for you have come, either, you tell in actuality..." Thus Rama asked her. On hearing the words 
of Rama she that demoness wetted with love said these words. [3-17-19]


"I will tell you truth, Rama, nothing but truth, I am a guise-changing demoness named Shuurpanakha, 
and I will be freely moving in this forest in a solitary manner and unnerving all. [3-17-20, 21a]


"My brother is valorous and mighty Ravana, the king of demons and the son of Vishravasa, if ever you 
have heard of him. [3-17-21b, 22a]


"And the mighty Kumbhakarna who will always be in profound sleep is my brother, and the virtue-souled 
Vibheeshana too is my brother, but he does not behave like a demon, and two more bothers of mine are 
Khara and Duushana who are renowned for their bravery in war. [3-17-22b, 23


"I can excel all of them by my bravery, oh, Rama, and on seeing you for the first time I had a notion 
that you being the choicest among men you alone are my husband, hence I neared you. [3-17-24]


"I am endowed with such preponderances and I can operate with my independent might, as such you become 
my everlasting husband  by the way, what can you bring off with Seetha. [3-17-25]


"Unlovely and unshapely is this one, such as she is, this Seetha is unworthy to be your wife, and I 
am the lone one worthy to be your wife, hence treat me as your wife. [3-17-26]


"Shall I eat up this disfigured, dishonest, diabolical human female with a hallow stomach along with 
him, that brother of yours to make you free.


"Afterwards, you can lustily ramble about Dandaka forest along with me while enjoying yourself on various 
mountaintops in the sky and in forests on the earth." So Shuurpanakha said to Rama. [3-17-28]


When he is said that way Rama chuckled and that wordsmith started to reply her who eyes are besotted 
in lovesickness with this sentence. [3-17-29]

On observing Shuurpanakha who is speaking bitter words against him in the presence of ministers then 
Ravana is highly infuriated and queried her. [1-34-1]


"Who is Rama? How brave he is? Of what mien and what calibre he is? And for what reason he entered the 
highly inscrutable Dandaka forest? [1-34-2]


"What is the weapon of that Rama by whom these many demons are killed in war, likewise Duushana and 
Trishira are killed, and even the unkillable Khara is killed? Oh, lady with fascinating limbs, who disfigured 
you? That you tell. [1-34-3, 4a]


When the king of demons has asked her thus, she that demoness Shuurpanakha who is in a fit of fury then 
commenced to describe Rama in the point of fact. [3-34-4b, 5a]


"Dasharatha's son Rama is the one with inescapable arms and keen-eyed, but has jute-cloths and skin 
of black-deer for his dress, yet in semblance he is similar to the Love-god. [3-34-5b, 6a]


"Yanking out a bow with golden fillets, and that is similar to the bow of Indra in its shine, he strews 
candent iron-arrows that simulate snakes with deadly poison. [3-34-6b, 7a]


"It has become imperceivable for me to me to see when and how he drew his ghastly arrows from quiver 
on the battleground; or, stretching his bow admitting those arrows on bowstring - no; or, his releasing 
those sharp edged arrows from the bow - no; why them, that great mighty Rama himself has become imperceptible 
in the fastness of his action. [3-34-7b, 8a]


"As with a crop of grain devastated by a hailstorm of Indra, I could only see that best army while it 
is being annihilated with a downpour of arrows. [3-34-8b, 9a]


"Thus a lone foot-soldier with his excruciating arrows has exterminated fourteen thousand demons with 
fiendish might, including Duushana, and along withKhara, say, within one and half hours. [3-34-9b,10]


"Accorded is the protection to the sages, and Dandaka is made as a snuggest place for them. I am the 
lone one somehow let off by such a high-minded Rama, of course, on humiliating me by cutting my nose 
and ears. Maybe, it is because he is hesitant of woman-slaughter for he is a well-versed soul. [1-34-11, 
12]


"A highly resplendent one who by his trait matches his brother in bravery, an adherent and a devotee 
of his brother, such a stout-hearted one is Rama's brother known as Lakshmana. [1-34-13]


"That Lakshmana is an easily irritable one, he is not that easily invincible, an easy victor, but not 
an easygoing valiant, yet he is an intellectual at ease, and a mighty one who does not ease off, such 
a Lakshmana is the perpetual right-hand and the peripherally moving life of Rama. [1-34-14]


"But, one with her broad-eyes, face similar to the full-moon is the dear and wedded wife of Rama, and 
she always takes delight in the well-being of her dear one, namely Rama. [1-34-15]


"She is the one with lengthy hairdo, her nose and thighs are fine, and that glorious one with fine looks 
is the wife of Rama, and she is beaming forth like a sylvan deity situated in that woodland, who in 
turn is like Goddess Lakshmi in a temporal form. [1-34-16]


"She has a complexion mathing the shade of refined gold, her nails are rosy and jutting, and she with 
her curvaceous hips and slim waist is the daughter of King of Videha, and known as Seetha. [1-34-17]


"So far I have not seen any goddess with such a comeliness; a gandharva female - no; a yaksha female 
- no; a kinnara female - no; and a woman, no, not on the face of earth! [1-34-18]


"To whom Seetha becomes a wife and around whom she gladly throws her arms after such a marriage, he 
lives more grandly than Indra in all the worlds. [1-34-19]


"She is a highly gracious lady, laudable by her bodily structure, incomparable by her appearance, and 
she will become a seemly wife of yours, and you too will become a best husband of hers. [1-34-20]


"Oh, mighty shouldered brother, but when I ventured to bring her as your wife, whose hips are broad, 
bosom fat and bulgy, face excellent, that cruel Lakshmana disfigured me. [1-34-21, 22a]


"You too will become a groveller at the arrows Lover-god in case you now see Vaidehi with a face shining 
like full-moon. [1-34-22, 23a]


"Hence, if you hatch an opinion to make her as your wife, and if you aspire success, now itself quickly 
put your best foot, namely your right foot, forward. [1-34-23]


"Oh, the king of demons Ravana, if this advise of mine is pleasing to you, let this idea be actualised 
without any shilly-shallying in your mind. [1-34-24]


"Oh, king of the demons, realise your stout-heartedness, and oh, great mighty one, let that immaculately 
limbed Seetha be abducted to become your wife. [1-34-25]


"On recognising that Rama with his straight shooting arrows destroyed the night-walkers positioned at 
Janasthaana, and further on distinguishing that Duushana, and even Khara, is dispatched, it is apt of 
you to awake to a workable action." Thus Shuurpanakha has earbashed Ravana. [1-34-26]

Then on going to Panchavati which is full with many serpents and predators, Rama said to splendidly 
brilliant Lakshmana. [3-15-1]


"We arrived at the place as indicated by the sage, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this region with its flowered 
forests is Panchavati." [3-15-2]


"In which place we have to situate our hermitage for our liking, for that cast your sight all over the 
forest, and indeed you are an expert in such matters. [3-15-3]


"In which place Vaidehi, likewise you and me too can take delight, where the woodland is scenic and 
the water is pleasurable, and where a water lake, ritual-firewood, flowers, and the sacred grass are 
available in proximity, oh, Lakshmana, such a place may be searched out. [3-15-4, 5]


When thus said by Rama, Lakshmana adjoined his palms and said this sentence to Rama in the presence 
of Seetha. [3-15-6]


"I am but a dependent, as long as you are there, may it be for innumerable years, I am your adherent, 
Rama, therefore you yourself tell me to build hermitage in such and such delightful place. [3-15-7]


Rama is gladdened by those words of that great resplendent Lakshmana, and he selected a place that comprised 
of all the attributes. [3-15-8]


On taking Lakshmana's hand by his hand Rama paced that beautiful place intended for the construction 
of hermitage up and down and spoke to Soumitri this way. [3-15-9]


"This is an evenly and propitious place surrounded with flowered trees and it is apt of you to erect 
hermitage here, traditionally. [3-15-10]


"This pleasing lake is seen here adjacently, beaming forth with its lotuses that are similar to sun 
in resplendence, and that are scented fragrantly. [3-5-11]


"This River Godavari is also seen from here, surrounded by blooming trees, spread over with swans, and 
beautified with kaarandava, and chakravaaka birds, as that contemplated soul sage Agastya had said. 
[3-15-12]


"Those soaring mountains are appearing beautiful with many caves, surrounded by flowered trees, flurried 
by animal herds, sounded by peacocks, and they are neither far-off nor very nearby. [3-15-13, 14]


"Here and there are the golden, silvery and coppery ores on the mountains, and they are shining forth 
like cow-eye ventilators on walls and also like the superb paintings on elephants. [3-15-15]


"These mountains are brightening with trees of Saala, Palmyra, Tamaala, Date Palms, Jackfruit and also 
thus with Punnaagaa. With Chuuta - Sweet Mango; Ashoka, Tialaka, even with Ketaka, Champaka trees, And 
even with Syandana, Sandalwood, Niipa, Paarnasa, Lakuch, dhava, Ashwakarna, Khadira, Shamii, Kimshuka, 
Paatala trees, and entwined are those and those trees with flowered shrubs, and along with climbers, 
and thus they brighten the mountains. [3-15-16, 17, 18]


"This place is holy, this is delightful and this is with many animals and birds, hence Soumitri, let 
us reside here along with this bird Jatayu." Thus said Rama to Lakshmana. [3-15-19]


Thus said by Rama to that remover of foe's valour and one with very great might, namely Lakshmana, he 
briskly erected a hermitage for his brother. [3-15-20]


Lakshmana built a very spacious straw-cottage there levelling and raising the clay for raised floor 
of the cottage, strongly pillared with long bamboos, thereupon on those pillars excellent rafters are 
made, and the branches of Shamii trees are spread out, twined firmly with twines of jute strands, and 
with the cross-laid bamboos for thatching, and over that blades of Kusha grass and leaves of Kaasha 
are spread and well over-covered for the roof, and thus that very great mighty Lakshmana made that best 
and very spacious straw-cottage with a levelled surface for residence of Raghava in the interests of 
Raghava alone, and it resulted as a feast to the eye. [3-15-21, 22, 23]


On his going to River Godavari that noble Lakshmana bathed and on gathering lotuses and fruits he returned 
to the cottage. [3-15-24]


Then making flowery offerings and peace-invocations also procedural to <font color="#B3003A">gR^iha 
pravesha</font> , entering a new house,] started to show the constructed hermitage to Rama. [3-15-25]


On seeing the beautifully constructed hermitage along with Seetha, Rama is highly gladdened in respect 
that straw-cottage. [3-15-26]


Then Rama very highly gladdened Rama embraced Lakshmana tightly by both of his hands, and spoke these 
friendly words to him. [3-15-27]


"Oh, masterful one, I am very happy about you for you have done a great deed, for that reason I am giving 
what I have to give to you a hugging. [3-5-28]


"You are the knower of others feelings, knower of many skills, and the knower of what is right and honest, 
oh, Lakshmana, such as you are, being with you I deem that my virtue-souled father is not gone and forgotten. 
[3-15-29]


On saying thus to Lakshmana, Raghava, the enhancer of magnificence comfortably resided in that province 
which is with many a fruit. [3-15-30]


While Seetha and Lakshmana devoted themselves to that righteous Rama, he resided in Panchavati like 
a Divinity in heavenly world for sometime to come. [3-15-30]

From here, until Rama meets Hanuma in next book Kishkindha, Rama's lamentation is continually portrayed. 
This may not be taken as a mere 'weeping' or 'bemoaning' of the principal character of the epic, but 
this has many poetics and romantics of epical poetry imbibed in it. An epic, basically, requires a hero 
to have his romantic attributes, <font color="#B3003A">naayaka lakshaNaaH</font> and these 'wailings' 
will portray all of them. There are various, numerous and voluminous derivatives, meanings and commentaries, 
which cannot possibly be included in here, at this stage, except for passing references on them. Hence, 
this lengthy lamentation has lengthier romanticism.


On seeing the vacant threshold of the hermitage and empty cottage of straw, also at the leaf-mat-seats 
that are utterly shattered, and not finding Vaidehi even on watchfully eyeing everywhere Rama shrieked 
loudly, and then on clasping the winning shoulders of Lakshmana he said this to him. [3-61-1, 2]


"Oh, Lakshmana, possibly where can be Vaidehi? Or, to which place she has gone from here? Or, Soumitri, 
who stole her away? Or, who has gorged up my ladylove? [3-61-3]


"Oh, Seetha, if you have concealed yourself under trees wishing to poke fun at me, enough is your fun 
and games, get in touch with me now, as I am highly anguished... [3-61-4]


"Oh, meek Seetha, with which meekly young deer you were playing, all these are now broody with tearfully 
fluttery looks, without you... [3-61-5]


"Really Lakshmana, I will not live long without Seetha, indeed I am enveloped in high anguish caused 
by the abduction of Seetha, and this alone will become a murderer, and on my going to other world when 
murdered by my own agony my father and that great king Dasharatha will definitely observe me in the 
other world... [3-61-6, 7a]


"When I go to other world after my death our father Dasharatha who is already staying there will deride 
me saying, 'when I have directed you for a fourteen year exile, and when you too have assuredly agreed 
and promised me for that term, how you have to my presence in this ultramundane world without completing 
that term of fourteen year exile, besides breaking your own word of honour... thus you have become a 
wilful disobedient, despicable and dishonest person, such as you are, fie on you...' [3-61-7b, 8, 9a]


"Anguish seared and bewildered me and I am woebegone with broken down buoyancy, and oh, beautiful lady, 
jilting such an woeful one as I am, where you are going now, as with prestige jilting a prevaricator? 
And if you shun me I will have to shun my life..." Thus Rama bewailed imaging her right in his front 
and running away. [3-61-9b, 10, 11a]


Though that legatee of Raghu is desperate for seeing Seetha, though he is highly anguished and agonised, 
though he bewailed this way, that Rama has not found Janaka's daughter, Seetha. [3-61-10b, 11a]


To him who is unable to find Seetha, and who is sinking in sadness as with an elephant sinking in a 
chasmal mud, Lakshmana spoke to such a Rama in a positive manner desiring his wellbeing. [3-61-11b, 
13]


"Oh, well-informed one, do not get into desperation, you make efforts along with me, and oh, brave one, 
this best mountain is beaming forth with many caves, she may be there somewhere. [3-61-14]


"Maithili is a fascinated saunterer in woodlands so she might have entered the forest, she is even infatuated 
with waters, so she might have gone to the fully bloomed lotus-lake, or to the river that is adorned 
by fishes and cane-breaks. [3-61-15]


"Or, wishing to know our reaction when she scares us with her prank, Maithili might have squirreled 
away into forest. Oh, honourable brother, let us endeavour quickly to search her. [3-61-16]


"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, if you consider that we shall search the forest in its entirety to locate where 
she that Janaka's daughter might be, let us quickly do so. But do not engulf your heart in sadness." 
Thus Lakshmana advised Rama. [3-61-18]


When Lakshmana good-heartedly spoke this way, Rama self-collectedly made a headway for the search of 
Seetha along with Soumitri. [3-61-19]


Those two sons of Dasharatha have started a thorough search for Seetha in forests, on mountains, also 
thus at rivers and lakes. [3-61-20]


On searching whole of mountainsides of that Mt. Chitrakuta, where their hermitage is there, even in 
its caves, crags, and mountain peaks they have not found Seetha. [3-61-21]


On exploring everywhere on that mountain Rama said to Lakshmana, "oh, Soumitri, here on this mountain 
I do not descry auspicious Vaidehi." [3-61-22]


While roving searchingly in Dandaka forest Lakshmana who is tormented by anguish said a sentence to 
his greatly resplendent brother Rama. [3-61-23]


"Oh, insightful brother, you will reacquire Janaka's daughter Maithili, as Vishnu once subjugated Emperor 
Bali and reacquired this earth." [3-61-24]


But when the valiant Lakshmana addressed him in that way, Raghava whose thinking is marred by poignance 
spoke these pathetic words. [3-61-25]


"This forest in its entirety, these lotus-lakes with their blossomed lotuses, and this mountain with 
its many caves and mountain-rapids, all are evidently searched. But, oh, sensible brother, I do not 
descry Vaidehi who is loftier than my lives." [3-61-27]


Lamenting in this way Rama languished owing to the abduction of Seetha and became a pitiable one, and 
while sadness besieging him he is perturbed for a moment. [3-61-28]


All the limbs of Rama are fluttered, his faculty has become functionless, his fervour is frozen, he 
is forlorn and flustered, and such as he is he sank down suspiring swelteringly and lengthily. [3-61-29]


Suspiring repeatedly he that lotus-eyed Rama shrieked repeatedly and loudly thus as, 'ha, Seetha...' 
with tears stifling his throat. [3-61-30]


Though Rama has many kinsfolk who hold him dear he is now left with a single one, namely Lakshmana, 
and that obedient brother Lakshmana who is already anguished for Rama's sadness, then adjoining his 
palms obediently started to pacify Rama with divers methods. [3-61-31]


But disavowing the word of advice that fell out from the cupped lips of Lakshmana, Rama stridently yelled 
again and again when his dear Seetha has become unseeable. [3-61-32]

			Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana enter the great forest called Dandaka Forest and adore the eminent sages, who are 
			in penance and hermitages in that forest. This canto is named as Aranya Kanda not just to show that Rama roved 
			over just forests. The forests, as per Indian tradition, are the treasure houses of knowledge, and they are 
			the ultimate in Vedic culture.


			Thus, until Ayodhya Kanda Rama's exile is in <font color="#B3003A">aaryavarta</font> , the place of noblemen, 
			from River Ganges to Greece. Now Rama is stepping into an area called <font color="#B3003A">janasthana</font>,meaning 
			people's place. This janasthana is the place where Rama eradicated certain negative aspects of the then anarchic 
			individualised dominions where jungle law was the only recourse and brought all of them under one roof. Though 
			people lived there about along with sages and demons as well, demonic influence is said to be predominant, as 
			per Ramayana or other Purana-s. These demons are narrated to be man-eaters, but not cannibals who eat their 
			own tribesmen.Recent discoveries revealed that the first humans were cannibals.


			The Science magazine reported about the excavations at Neanderthals Neander Valley, Germany. In the words of 
			Alban Defleur of the Universite de la Mediterranee at Masrseilles, France, "The finding allows us for the first 
			time to demonstrate the existence of the practice of cannibalism by European eanderthals." It is not clear from 
			the excavations of Neanderthals, whether the cannibalism was practised for survival or as a ritual.And even 
			at Alveston in the western English country of Gloucestershire, recently found are such human thighbones, which 
			had been split down the middle to remove marrow. Archaeologists of Bristol University are saying that the evidence 
			indicated the victims could have been disabled and deformed people in society. They have been murdered and eaten, 
			and the radiocarbon dating suggests these finds are about 2000 years ago. This practice is attributed to some 
			underworld cults during the later Iron Age. That being the situation in Europe, in the knowable history, in 
			Ramayana that has happened in an unknown era, the rakshasa-s are narrated to be man-eaters, but not as cannibals.But 
			the accounts given in Aranya Kanda and elsewhere, in ancient India the rakshasa-s ate up humans neither for 
			their own survival nor for ritual but to exhibit their tyranny and their barbaric supremacy. They never reported 
			to have eaten their own clansmen, but have a palate for other breed. Hence it is not exactly cannibalism, but 
			a barbaric act to exert savage scare. This is what the sages advise Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana when departing 
			towards Dandaka Aranya, and indirectly suggest eradicating such a savage atmosphere in peaceful forests.


			When it comes to <font color="#B3003A">isms</font> , it is said that the whole clash is between
			<font color="#B3003A">Vaishnavaites</font> and <font color="#B3003A">Shaivites</font> or
			<font color="#B3003A">Shaaktaites</font> , because the raakshasa-s are invariably Shiva worshippers, where Vaishnavism 
			is a later development. All the raakshasa-s or demons [in fact the term 'demon' do not suit them,] portrayed 
			hereafter, are ardent worshippers of Shiva, and have every blessing from Shiva or Brahma. It is an ethnicity 
			of its own which lived rich lives, pompous in attributes, wielded magical powers, and unabatedly performed anything 
			that is beneficial for them.Their riches and glory will be reflected in Sundara Kanda, which will be burnt down 
			by Hanuma, humbling this deleterious ethnicity, even before Rama's war with Ravana. Such an ethnic culture will 
			be portrayed hereafter, in constant conflict with Rama, and Rama eradicating each and every member of such ethnicity 
			that goes against any civility.


			Rama does much good in jansthana in wiping out those cultures of greedily dictatorial, magically overpowering, 
			and ruinous to other forms of civility. In fact this Aranya Kanda is not explained in vivid terms by the ancient 
			commentators, and if things are probed deeper in this book, Aranya Kanda, Rama did more social work than miracles.Hence 
			much can be explored into this Aranya Kaanda, the Book of Forest, in terms of sociological, demographically 
			and ethnological pursuits of Rama to establish one great orderly civil empire under one emperor, that is what 
			we call Rama Raajya. Further, it will be narrated that Rama killed these Rakshasas in thousands, which is objected 
			by materialists as how can an archer eliminate so many thousands of Rakshasas, with just a bow and arrows.It 
			may be remembered that Sage Viswamitra accords many kinds of missiles to Rama, after the killing of Tataka, 
			the demoness, in Bala Kanda.It may not be surprising for this generation to know that a single trigger can create 
			havoc of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and then in all its probability Rama also might have triggered in the same way, 
			with the missiles endowed by Sage Viswamitra.


On entering the impenetrable Dandaka forest that courageous and unassailable Rama saw a clusters of hermitages of sages. 
[3-1-1]


Overspread with Darbha, the sacred grass, and jute clothing, well pervaded with Vedic splendour and well glowing like the 
un-seeable solar arena in the sky, with naked eye. [3-1-2]


On looking at the rising red sun, the devotee is asking "Oh! Pooshan! God Sun, nourisher of the universe, the trueness of 
the Supreme is covered by your golden disk like vessel, [i.e., your Solar disk,] slide it aside, for as a truthful and righteous 
devotee, I visualize [that which is beyond your golden Solar disc.]


Those hermitages have well-tidied thresholds on all sides, dense with many deer and teemed with many groups of birds, and 
they are the recourse for all living beings. [3-1-3]


Those hermitages are always adored by groups of apsarasa-s with their continued dancing, their Holy Fireplaces are very 
broad, and are with oblation items, vessels, deerskins and sacred grass, and they are beaming forth with gigantic trees 
that yield sacred and palatable fruits, and with ritual fuels, and water vessels, tubers and fruits. [3-1-4, 5]


Those hermitages are sacrosanct for Ritual fire is being worshiped with fire-oblations and sacrifices to the reverberating 
Vedic sounds, and they are enwrapped with lotus ponds with lotuses, and even with flowers of forest. [3-1-6]


They have age-old saints with controlled senses who are clad in jute cloths and deerskin, and who subsist on fruits and 
tubers alone, ye their resplendence is like that that of the Sun-god or the Fire-god. [3-1-7]


Rama has seen such a cluster of hermitages that is glistening forth just by the presence of holy saints whose sustenance 
is constrained, and that hermitage is distinctive like Brahma's abode, reverberating with the sounds of that Brahma's Vedic 
chants alone. [3-1-8]


That glorious and great resplendent Rama on seeing those precincts of hermitage that is graced with highly blest Brahmans, 
the knowers of Brahma, neared it, unstringing the bowstring of his great bow. [3-1-9-10a]


Those great sages, the possessors of divine knowledge, are gladdened on seeing Rama and illustrious Seetha, and they moved 
towards them welcomingly. [3-1-10-11a]


But those sages who are austerely committed to vows, on their seeing Rama, the treader on the path of rectitude, and who 
is now arising like moon, and at Lakshmana and at glorious Seetha as well, rendered Vedic blessings and welcomed the trio. 
[3-1-11a-12]


Those forest-dwelling sages saw the physical built, its augustness and gracefulness, and his fine attire remaining in astonished 
postures. [3-1-13]


The forest-dwellers saw Seetha, Lakshmana and Rama, without a wink on their own eyes, as that trio is causing surprise with 
their arrival.


The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes [like celestial beings, who do not 
have the winking property on their eyes like living beings,] as their arrival is causing surprise.


The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes [as though the Vishnu along with Goddess 
Lakshmi and Thousand headed-serpent, <font color="#B3003A">aadi sheSha</font> are coming from their abode
<font color="#B3003A">vaikunTha</font> to this hermitage, for this hermitage is like Brahma's abode, as already said, thus 
the sages lost their wink. And loosing any single wink will loose the sight of these divinities from
<font color="#B3003A">vaikunTha</font>; hence their unannounced arrival caused surprise in them, which further caused a 
wink-less state [3-1-14]


Those august sages that are interested in the well being of all beings have indeed accommodated Rama in that hermitage, 
as Rama is their guest a priori. [3-1-15]


Then those august sages who are similar to sacred fire in glow have procedurally accorded guestship to Rama, and fetched 
water for him. [3-1-17]


On sounding out Vedic blessings those virtuous sages have offered flowers, fruits and tubers, and even the entire hermitage 
to that great soul Rama, and then with their palms adjoined. [3-1-17-18a]


"The king will have great renown for he is the ruler of the righteousness of these people, a protector, a respectable and 
adorable one, and as he wields the sceptre of justice, he is a revered one too... [3-1-18-19a]


"The fourth part of Indra is the protector of people, called the king, and hence Oh! Raghava, the king is hailed, and hence 
he enjoys best and delightful fortune... [3-1-19b-20a]


"You alone have to protect us as we are the subjects living in your kingdom..May you be in the capital... or in the forest...you 
are our king... [3-1-20b,c]


"We gave-up punishments, either physically or by the power of curses, conquered are our anger and senses, and our ascesis 
is the only wealth of ours, thus oh! King, we are to be protected by you, like the foetus inside a womb... [3-1-21]


Thus saying they worshipped Raghava along with Lakshmana, on giving fruits, tubers, flowers and other varieties of forest 
foods. [3-1-22]


Thus other saints and sages who are the followers of the virtue, and similar to the Sacred Fire adored Rama, the king, according 
to the wont of custom. [3-1-23]

Jataayu who is slumbering away craned and stared on hearing the voicing of Seetha and then he saw Ravana 
and even Vaidehi. [3-50-1]


That best bird majestic Jataayu with a very sharp beak and appearing like a mountain peak, then uttered 
these words of expediency still perching on a tree. [3-50-2]


"Oh, brother, now it is inapt of you to undertake a deplorable deed. I am one of those who abide by 
perpetual probity and avowed to truthfulness. Such as I am, oh, Decahedral-demon Ravana, I am the mightiest 
king of eagles known by the name Jataayu. [3-50-3, 4a]


"Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is the master of all the world, one similar to Mahendra and Varuna, the 
Rain-god, and the one who is connected with the well-being of all the world. [3-50-4b, 5a]


"Whom you desire to abduct now, that best lady is Seetha by her name, and this glorious one is the legitimate 
wife of that preserver of all the worlds, namely Rama. [3-50-5b, 6a]


"How a king adhering to probity can lay his hands on the wives of others? If it is a king's wife, oh, 
great-mighty Ravana, she is to be safeguarded particularly. [3-50-6b, 7a]


"Reverse your filthy course, or fortuity, or mind form laying your hands on other's wives. A sagacious 
person does not undertake that deed by which others deplore him. As with the protection of one's own 
wife from somebody's laying hands on her, other person's wife is also to be protected in that way. [3-50-8 
[3-50-7b, 8]


"If the means to gain probity, or prosperities, or even pleasures are inconspicuous in scriptures, oh, 
the scion of Paulastya, then even the erudite scholars will conduct themselves following the king and 
his demeanour. [3-50-9]


"A king is the best repository for probity, prosperities, and pleasures, and whether it is probity or 
felicity or even iniquity that will emerge from the fount called king. [3-50-10]


"Oh, prominent one among demons, deviltry and mercuriality are but natural for you demons, but how you 
have amassed affluence, as with an evildoer attaining an aircraft that puts him to flight to heaven.


"You by your nature are a devilish and mercurial personality though you have come from a decent lineage, 
how you have become an outranking demon among demons and how you could attain kingdom, which is to be 
ruled righteously, like an evildoer attaining a heaven-bound aircraft. [3-50-11]


"He whose nature is such, that nature is perhaps impossible to efface, a sermon does not dwell in the 
heart of an evil-minded one for a long time, indeed.


"He whose nature itself is vile, it is perhaps impossible for him to efface it, and in the residence 
of such an evil-minded person, evilly acquired prosperity does not dwell for a long time, indeed. [3-50-12]


"When that great-mighty Rama has not transgressed either in your country or in your city Lanka, then 
how you become a transgressor in respect of that noble-souled Rama? [3-50-13]


"If Rama of indefatigable deeds firstly eliminated Khara who is stationed at Janasthaana, and who transgressed 
for the sake of Shuurpanakha, tell me what in actuality is the highly overstepping behaviour of Rama 
in that matter, whereupon you are stealing off with the wife of such a lord of world? [3-50-14, 15]


"Instantly deliver up Vaidehi. Let not the disastrous and glowing fire-like eyes of Rama, which transmogrify 
so when he assumes fury, burn you down as the Thunderbolt of Indra once burnt the demon Vritta. [3-50-16]


"You are unconscious that you have presently bundled a lethally venomous serpent at the fringe of your 
attire, and you are equally unwary that the Terminator's lasso is presently loosened around your neck. 
[3-50-17]


"Oh, cultured one, that weight alone is to be shouldered by which a man is not brought down, and that 
repast alone is to be consumed by which nothing upsets. [3-50-18]


"Who will undertake a deed that yields neither probity, nor deference, nor distinction but results in 
just physical drudgery? [3-50-19]


"I have dedicated myself to the kingdom of my fathers and forefathers according to tradition, and sixty 
thousand years have elapsed since I was born. [3-50-20]


"You are youngish whereas I am oldish, you are an armoured archer darting arrows from an air-chariot, 
whereas I am pensile bird in an open sky. Nevertheless, on taking Vaidehi you cannot abscond safely. 
[3-50-21]


"It will be incapable of you to forcibly abduct Vaidehi when I keep an eye one her, as with the defilement 
of definitive Vedic scriptures by the logicians, dialecticians, materialists and suchlike non-believers, 
with their conjectural logic.


"Veda-s are definitive in their canons and their authority is established beyond doubt, yet the doubtful 
scholarly logicians still try to pamper their import with their conjectural logic, and when I am watchful 
of what is going on I do not let you pamper Seetha, as such take this caution and release her. [3-50-22]


"Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right 
away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier. 
[3-50-23]


"He who eliminated demons and ogres in combats time after time, that Rama though apparently attired 
in jute-cloths like a meek-saint, will become a towering-inferno in a given combat, and he eliminates 
you very soon. [3-50-24]


"What can possibly be done by me when those princes have gone far-off! It is beyond the scope of my 
fetching them in time! You knave, you who are scared of them will now be lost to my blockade, without 
a doubt. [3-50-25]


"When I am alive you cannot lead away this auspicious, lotus-leave-eyed Seetha, the dear queen of Rama. 
[3-50-26]


"But I must definitely accomplish something to forestall you till they come, for I cannot willingly 
depart from here to fetch any of the two brothers, and that deed I needs must do shall be agreeable 
to the great-souled Rama, likewise even to Dasharatha, even at the stake of my life. [3-50-27]


"Stopoff! Stopoff! Oh, Decahedral Ravana, briefly learn of me as how I jettison you from your best air-chariot, 
as with the unloading of a burdensome fruit from its sepals. Oh, nightwalker, I will be giving guestship 
to you in a duel as long as I am alive. [3-50-28]

"Thus I was somehow released by him in a confrontation then in his teens. Now you
may also listen to what has happened later in his adulthood." Thus Maareecha continued his advise
to Ravana. [4-39-1]


"Though Rama hit me previously in such a way, I unabashedly entered Dandaka forest
together with two more demons who were in the guise of animals. [4-39-2]


"On becoming a gigantic carnivorous animal with a torching tongue, incisive teeth
and excruciating horns, and with an extraordinary energy, I was on the rove in Dandaka forest while
getting at Rama. [4-39-3]


"I moved about Dandaka forest, oh, Ravana, in an extremely horrible aspect of
animal, utterly brutalising the sages at ritual-altars, holy bathing places and under the trees of
religious sanctuaries while reaching Rama. [4-39-4]


"I have proceeded to Rama killing saints in Dandaka forest who are the treaders in
saintliness, and drinking off their blood and feasting on their flesh. [4-39-5]


"On becoming such a brutal animal I have been eating the flesh of sages, frightening
the forest dwellers, and in that way I rambled in Dandaka forest besotted with blood-drinking while
reaching Rama. [4-39-6]


"While I was wandering in Dandaka forest as an abuser of virtue, then I reached Rama
who by then has assumed the rectitude befitting to a saint, and I even reached the great-fortunate
Vaidehi and top-speeded-chariot-rider Lakshmana. [4-39-7, 8a]


"I was in the shape of an animal with incisive horns. Such as I was I recollected my
earlier grudge against that great mighty Rama who takes delight in the welfare of all being, who by
then was santlike on a regulated diet and abiding in the forest, whereby I presumed him to be mere
hermit. In that way, I was very extremely infuriated to recollect his earlier assault on me, and I
indiscriminately dashed towards him, only to kill him, completely disregarding his other faculties.
[4-39-8b, 9, 10]


"Stringing out his highly magnificent bow Rama then released three excruciating and
enemy eliminating arrows which in their egress match the Air-god and the Divine-Eagle Garuda.
[4-39-11]


"All those three thunderbolt like arrows that have only blood for their board,
acutely bent at barbs, and that are highly horrendous have come at us in a coordinated manner.
[4-39-12]


"As I have earlier seen the fear caused by his arrow I am in the know of Rama's
valour, hence I retreated from there trickily and gingerly, but the other two demons were killed.
[4-39-13]


"When I was somehow exempted by the arrow of Rama I regained lifespan, and when that
arrow made me to renounce everything like a monk and fled me to this place, the other side of ocean
to where you came by your aircraft, here I am living here in a yogic way, self-collectedly like an
ascetic. [4-39-14]


"From then on wards, I am indeed descrying Rama at this tree and at that tree,
dressed in jute-cloths and black deerskin, and handling his bow like the Terminator handling a
tether. [4-39-15]


"Given to fright I even visualise thousands Rama-s, and whole this forest is
reflecting to me as one entity of Rama. [4-39-16]


"Even at a place void of people I am envisaging Rama alone, and oh, king of demons,
even if he enters my dream, in fact, I am jolting up and swooning. [4-39-17]


"Oh, Ravana, appalled of Rama the names starting with the syllable '<em>ra</em>' like
<em>ratna</em>-s, <em>ratha</em>-s, viz., gemstones, chariots are appalling to me, including your name, that starts
with a '<em>ra</em>....' [4-39-18]


"I am well-acquainted with his efficacy, and a war with him will be an unfair thing
for you, for that Raghu's descendant can in fact kill either Emperor Bali or Namuchi, the demon.
[4-39-19]


"You may either wage a war with Rama if you wish to avenge the killings of Khara and
others, or forgive and forget that Rama agreeing to my suggestions, but do not broach the topic of
Rama with me if you wish to see me alive. [4-39-20]


"In the world many of the sagacious and reasonable people that are the practisers of
righteousness are utterly ruined along with their kith and kin, just by the misdeeds of others.
[4-39-21]


"Such a saintly one as I am, I am bound to ruin by other's misdeeds, hence you do
whatever that is fair to you, but I am not the one to simply take after you. [4-39-22]


"Definitely Rama is the one with exceptional resplendence, exemplary courage and
extraordinary power, and for sure, he becomes an eradicator of the world of demons. [4-39-23]


"If Khara positioned in Janasthaana has firstly overstepped his bounds and attacked
Rama, that too owing to Shuurpanakha, and if Rama of uncomplicated actions has eliminated Khara in
self-defence, what really is the transgression of Rama in that matter, you tell of that in the
final analysis. [4-39-24]


"I am saying this word of advise as I am ambitious of the wellbeing of my kinsmen
through you, and if this is disagreeable to you, you will have to deliver up your life in a
confrontation with Rama along with the lives of your kinsmen, perishing at the linearly
accelerating arrows of Rama. [4-39-25]

While Rama is bewailing like a forlorn as his anguish is scorching him, rendered
impoverished with an inanimate heart as a high passion possessed him, Lakshmana, the son of
Sumitra, suppliantly gripped his feet and started to address him. [4-66-1, 2]


"Oh, Rama, as gods have reaped ambrosia after a prolonged churning of Milky Ocean,
you are a reap of King Dasharatha's superlative ascesis and even by his superior acts...
[4-66-3]


"Our father was an enlivener of all the subjects and that king was beholden only to
your rosy endowments, but he obtained godhood by your separation... this is what we heard from
Bharata... [4-66-4]


"If you are unable to withstand this anguish chanced on you, oh, Kakutstha, then how
a simpleton and whose boldness is meagre can withstand it... [4-66-5]


"Oh, first and foremost man, tell me who is uncaught by mischance, which mischance
will be catchy like fire-catch, and oh, king, even that, that lets up momently... [4-66-6]


"If you are going to blaze away worlds with your radiance in your ruefulness, to
where the ordinary people in rue shall go for solace, really... [4-66-7]


"World's disposition is this way only, even if Nahusha, the son Yayaati, has become
an egalitarian with Indra, writhe touched him off... [4-66-8]


"Which great sage Vashishta is there, who is also the priest of our father, he
parented a hundred sons in one day and like that they are all eliminated in one day by Vishvamitra,
for which Vashishta also lamented, but not for a long... [4-66-9]


"This Mother Earth who is the mother of worlds and venerated by all animate and
inanimate, or even celestial beings, oh, king of Kosala kingdom, even she undergoes tremors and
earthquakes... [4-66-10]


"Which duteous pair is the pair of eyes of the world in whom all the systems of
world are peremptory, though that pair of Sun and Moon are doughtily influential in this solar
system, eclipse draws nigh of them... [4-66-11]


"Even very great incorporates like earth and suchlike planets, oh, bullish man, or
even the gods, or even all corporeal beings, cannot get release from the predestine of Supreme
Being... [4-66-12]


"Oh, tigerly-man, we hear that whether gods like Indra et al., are ethical and/or
unethical, yet they too have the resultant agonies and ecstasies... hence, it is inapt of you to
fret thyself... [4-66-13]


"Whether Vaidehi is stolen or slain, oh, brave one, it will be inapt of you sadden
like this as with any other commoner without tracking her whereabouts... [4-66-14]


"Persons of your like who are always equable in their outlook, oh, Rama, they will
remain non-dispirited even if they are undergoing desperate straits, and they will not just sadden
like this... [4-66-15]


"Oh, foremost man among men, you ratiocinate in subtle pursuit, objectively and
brainily, and great brains will comprehend good and bad in subtlety with their braininess...
[4-66-16]


"Indiscernible are the rights and wrongs of actions, and indefinite are the
cherished fruits of those actions, and without performing any action, fruits also will be
nonexistent... [4-66-17]


"The great brains with their braininess are clearly comprehending the indiscernible,
indefinite or infirm rights and wrongs of their actions, thus they translate their thinking into
action... and thus they are undertaking humanly possible action... but not sitting back, unlike
you...


Oh, brave one, to those that are interested in endeavours, whether or not they are
uninterested in the results of their actions, either rights or wrongs, but even to them cherished
fruits does not occur, effortlessly...


"Oh valiant one, indeed you alone have said this way to me previously and
repeatedly, who really can profess you even he were to be professedly the Jupiter... [4-66-18]


"Oh, great discerner, your thinking process is non-explicatory even to gods, but now
that thinking process is obliquely and utterly slumberous owing to your sadness, hence I am
addressing your percipience and this is no schoolteaching... [4-66-19]


"Oh, foremost one among Ikshvaku, oh, Rama, contemplate the divineness of those
immortals and their pure being in maintaining world order, also consider the humanness of these
mortals and their helpless susceptibility to pain, also count on your own valour that which can
annihilate the whole of anything... and then come to conclusion whether or not to annihilate
everything... but, before that try hard to eliminate the abuser, lest he may abuse many others...
[4-66-20]


"Oh, best one among Ikshvaku-s, oh, Rama, contemplate the divine valour you have
derived, also consider the human valour you have inherited, also count on your own innate valour...
hence, try hard to eliminate the abuser...


"Oh, best one among men, what is it you gain on performing a complete annihilation
owing to a single soul's malefaction, hence, mark him... that malefactor and a malevolent of yours,
and it will be apt of you to uproot him... him alone... [4-66-21]

While fiercely valorous Khara proceeded towards Rama's hermitage, Rama along with his brother Lakshmana 
has indeed seen the very same auguries which have earlier appeared to Khara. [3-24-1]


On looking at those very gruesomely bad omens, and perceiving them to be unpropitious to people, Rama 
spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. [3-24-2]


"Oh, dextrous Lakshmana, for the complete elimination of all the demons these great indications have 
arisen, as though betokening the annihilation of all beings. See them. [3-24-3]


"On their part these clouds are hovering on the sky with stark reddish-grey tint, thunderously braying 
and copiously showering streams of blood. [3-24-4]


"All my arrows too are incensed to fuming in an ecstasy towards a war, and dorsally gold-plated bows 
of mine are incessantly spurring to hook up those arrows, telling apart the impeding conflict. [3-24-5]


"Judging by the kind of wild birds that are shrieking here, danger is up ahead and coming upon us, along 
with uncertainty of our lives. [3-24-6]


"This right hand of mine is indicating by its repeated throbbing that a critical and riotous conflict 
is going to occur, no doubt, but oh brave one, our victory and defeat to the enemies are also in vicinity, 
and for sure, your face is also appearing brightish and aglow, which itself is a good omen. [3-24-8] 
[3-24-7, 8]


"If the faces of those that are poised for a conflict loose lustre, deem that the death is looming large 
on their longevity too. [3-24-9]


"This nasty noise which we hear pertains to the uproar of demons, and even to the drumming of war drums 
by the demons of fiendish activities, and this is ear-splitting. [3-24-10]


"Preventive measures are to be effectuated for any imminent situation by any well-wishing person, or 
by a person with misgivings about a danger, or by a person of talent. [3-24-11]


"Hence, wield your bow, keep arrows ready at hand, and taking Vaidehi with you seek shelter in a impassable 
cave of a mountain overgrown with trees. [3-24-12]


"I wish you to gainsay me for this word of mine, my boy, have honour on my feet and be gone not before 
long. [3-24-13]


"You are a stalwart, a forceful one, and for sure you can eliminate them all, it is doubtless, but I 
long to eliminate all of the nightwalkers, personally" Rama said thus to Lakshmana. [3-24-14]


When Rama said to him that way, Lakshmana picked up his bow and arrows, and together with Seetha he 
took shelter in an unreachable cave. [3-24-15]


On Lakshmana's entering into cave along with Seetha, Rama said to himself, "thank goodness, it is a 
good-idea!" and thus saying he donned his shield. [3-24-16]


Well bedecked in a shield that has fire-like brilliance that Rama shone forth like a fumeless conflagration 
up-shot in utter darkness. [3-24-17]


On raising his imposing bow and drawing arrows, that valorous Rama firmed up and stood there, filling 
all the directions with the tinny sounds of bowstring. [3-24-18]


Gods with gandharva-s and great-souled siddha-s along with carana-s have then met one another and came 
there aspiring to see the war. [3-24-19]


The great-souled sages and those that are known in worlds as eminent Brahma-sages, on their coming together 
those beings of pious exploits spoke to one another, among themselves. [3-24-20]


"Let good betide cows, Brahmans and those people that are abiding in all the worlds. Raghava shall be 
victorious in the war over the clansmen of Sage Paulastya, the nightwalkers." Thus they talked among 
themselves. [3-24-21]


Thus speaking they also well-said again, looking at each other "the demons of fiendish deeds are fourteen 
thousand in number and this virtue-souled Rama is solitary... what would be the result of this war!" 
Thus the sages discussed among themselves. [3-24-22b, 23]


Thus the assemblages of kingly-sages, siddha-s and the eminent Brahmans, along with gods that are staying 
in their aircrafts, tarried there in the firmament peering inquisitively at Rama. [3-24-24]


Immured in an aura of invincibility Rama is standing up to the war in its vanguard, and then on seeing 
at him all beings went into the throes of dread. [3-24-25]


That nonesuch aspect of Rama whose deeds are unharmful to any, has become the aspect of wrathful supreme-souled 
Rudra. [3-24-26]


While gods, gandharva-s, carana-s are conversing thus, then they have seen there the legions of the 
demons arriving from all over with boisterous noises, spouting cries of bravo, handling their grisly 
skins, shields, weaponry and war-flags, and onrushing at each other in disarray. With brassy twanging 
of bows, with the drumming of war drums, and even by their jumping, leaping and bouncing that area is 
filled with very loud and clamorous noise. [3-24-27, 28, 29]


When highly brutish cacophony of demons started to fill the forest, that jangling even panicked the 
brutes ranging in that forest, and those beasts dashed off to other places where silence prevailed, 
without looking back. [3-24-30, 31a]


And that foolhardy army of demons which in simile is like an unnavigable ocean steered towards Rama 
handling many assault weapons. [3-24-31b, 32a]


Casting his sight all-over even that war-expert Rama has seen that army of Khara lunging at a conflict. 
[3-24-32b, 33a]


Rama stretched his awesome bow to examine the taut of bowstring, and even whipped arrows out of quiver, 
and then adopted a mask of extreme wrath to eliminate all the demons. [3-24-33]


And when he is enraged and blazing he became frightful-looking like the blazing Fire at the end of era, 
and on seeing such a Rama when he is pervaded with conflagration like anger, the pastoral deities are 
very much annoyed. [3-24-34]


The all-pacific aspect of that Rama then in his exasperation appeared to be like that of the all-ruinous 
Rudra, the wielder of bow called Pinaki, namely peaceful Shiva when enraged, at the time of Rudra's 
embarking on to ruin the Vedic ritual of Daksha Prajaapati. [3-24-35]


That army of raw-flesh eaters with their bows, embellishments, and chariots, and also with their armours, 
all glittering with the dazzle of flaming fire, varied into a sky-blue coloured cluster of clouds on 
which the dazzling sunrays will be glittering at the dawning of the sun. [3-24-36]

"At one time even I was on the rove around this earth, taking pride in my valour,
bearing the strength of a thousand elephants, mountainous in my size and black-cloudlike in my
sheen, wearing ear-knobs and a crown made out of refined gold, with a bludgeon as my weapon, and
such as I was, I rambled Dandaka forest causing terror to the world, and eating the fleshes of
sages." Thus Maareecha started to narrate his experience with Rama. [3-38-1, 2]


"The virtue-souled great-saint Vishvamitra who was highly scared of me, then on
going to Dasharatha in person that great-saint spoke this to that lord of people. [3-38-3b, 4a]


" 'An awesome dismay has befallen owing to this Maareecha, oh, lord of people
Dasharatha, let Rama safeguard me becoming alert at the opportune time of the Vedic-ritual.
[3-38-4b 5a]


"When he is spoken in that way, then that virtue-souled king Dasharatha replied that
great-fortunate and great-saint Vishvamitra in this way. [3-38-5b, 6a]


" 'This boy Rama is less than twelve years in his age, unproficient in the use of
weapons, and if need be, whatever army of mine is there it will march on along with me instead of
Rama. [3-38-6b, 7a]


" 'And having come in person with fourfold forces, oh eminent sage, I myself will
eradicate that nightwalker whomever you indicate as an enemy of yours." So said Dasharatga to
Vishvamitra. [3-38-7b, 8a]


"When the sage Vishvamitra is spoken thus, then he said to the king, 'No other force
in the world than Rama can counterbalance that demon. [3-38-8b, 9a]


" 'No doubt, you are a defender of gods in wars, and oh, king, the exploits you have
undertaken on behalf of gods are well-known in the triad of worlds. [3-38-9b, 10a]


" 'Maybe your army is a remarkable one, oh, enemy-inflamer, let it sit tight here
alone, and even if this great resplendent one is still a boy he alone is competent to forestall
that Maareecha, hence oh, enemy-subjugator, let good betide you, I wish to take him alone along
with me.' [3-38-10b, 11]


"Thus that way on saying he that sage Vishvamitra returned to his own hermitage
highly gladdening to take the prince Rama along with him. [3-38-12]


"Then in Dandaka forest Rama twingeing his amazing bow stayed nearby the sage
Vishvamitra who entered the vow of Vedic-ritual. [3-38-13]


"At that time, yet unborn are the identities of adulthood like moustache on his
face, and that providential one was magnificent in looks with a peacock-blue complexion, wearing a
single cloth, locks of hair, and golden locket, and wielding a bow, and he was irradiating the
Dandaka forest with a radiating radiance of his own, and then he appeared like the just risen
baby-moon. [3-38-14, 15]


"And I who was like a massive black-cloud, wearing golden ear-knobs, already a
forceful one further reinforced with the boon of Brahma, I pridefully entered into the interior of
Vishwamitra's hermitage. [3-38-16]


"Rama quickly noticed me on my very entry with an uplifted weapon, and on seeing me
he unexcitedly strung bowstring to his bow. [3-38-17]


"Unmindfully trivialising him as, 'this Raghava is just a boy,' I made haste and ran
towards that Fire-altar of Vishvamitra. [3-38-18]


"He then released an acute arrow that eliminates the enemy, and hit by it I am
plunged into the ocean which was a hundred yojana-s off. [3-38-19]


"That Rama did not wish to kill me then, and I am thus saved by that valiant one,
oh, dear boy Ravana, but the thrust of Rama's arrow bewildered my animation and I was on my last
legs. [3-38-20]


"That way I who had been flung into the abyssal water of the ocean by him gained
consciousness after a long time and proceeded towards the city of Lanka. [3-38-21]


"At that time, that one with elementary knowledge in the use of weaponry, but who
can undertake deeds in an effortless manner, such a boy, such a Rama spared me, albeit killing them
that were my helpmates in that escapade. [3-38-22]


"Thereby, if you wish to make for any confrontation with Rama, despite of my
proscribing you, you will ruin yourself on getting a disastrous calamity. [3-38-23]


"The demons are methodical in sporting and flirting, thus by their own conduct they
are also socialising and frolicking, and to them you derive distress and disaster. [3-38-24]


"Dense with skyscrapers and palaces, and decorated with many a gemstone is that city
Lanka, but you will see it completely shattered down, for the sake of that Maithili. [3-38-25]


"Even if with uncommitted sins, the sinless will get ruined owing to their
interdependence with other sinners, like the fish in a lake with snakes. [3-38-26]


"Bedaubed with divine sandal-paste, beautified with divine ornaments are the limbs
of the demons now, perchance you will be seeing them trampled out on ground for the blunder of
yours. [3-38-27]


"Maybe, you will have to see the fleeing of the nightwalkers surviving after the
carnage in all ten directions, some abandoning their wives and some along with their wives, only
for lack of a protector. [3-38-28]


"Without a doubt you will be seeing Lanka encircled with an enmesh of arrows,
enfolded in the tongues of torches, while her buildings are utterly gutting down. [3-38-29]


"Oh, king, there is no other sin that is outrageous and gravest than the dalliance
with another's wife and, besides, you already have a thousand wives, isn't so! [3-38-30]


"Abide by your own wife and be delighted with her, oh, demon, safeguard your own
ethnos, thus safeguard dignity, affluence, and kingdom of demons, thereby safeguard even your own
dear life. [3-38-31]


"If you desire to take pleasure with your beautiful wives and with your friend's
circles for a long time, do not do anything undesirable to Rama. [3-38-32]


"If you wish to intimidate Seetha aggressively despite of my considerable preventing
in all my good-heartedness towards you, then your army will fade away, and you with your kinsfolk
will emigrate to the world of Yama, the Terminator, for your life will be taken away by the arrow
of Rama." Thus, Maareecha spoke to Ravana. [3-38-33]

While Shabari ascended to heaven with her own divine self-resplendence, Raghava who is with Lakshmana 
started to cogitate over the magnificence of Matanga disciples. [3-75-1]


That noble-souled Raghava on thinking about the efficacy of the disciples of Matanga, said to Lakshmana, 
who is the maintainer of Rama's well being, and who is thinking single-mindedly. [3-75-2]


"I have seen a highly astounding hermitage of self-controlled sages, oh, gentle Lakshmana, in which 
the deer and tigers are at home, and which is adored by divers birds... [3-75-3]


"Oh, Lakshmana, holy is our taking a bath in this holy Pampa Lake, for it is formed by the waters of 
seven seas, and even holier is our oblation of this holy waters to manes... [3-75-4]


"What that was unpropitious for us is completely abated by our holy bath and holy oblations, oh, Lakshmana, 
propitiousness is standing en face us, thereby presently this heart of mine is highly gladdening... 
oh, lion-like man, indeed, heart alone hatches hope... [3-75-5, 6a]


"Thereby, where Mt. Rishyamuka is beaming forth at its nearby, on which that right minded son of the 
Sun, Sugreeva, is living along with four other vanara-s, always frightened by the fear from Vali, we 
will go to her, to that spectacular Lake Pampa, come on, Lakshmana... [3-75-6b, 7, 8a]


"I am also hasty to see that best one among vanara-s, Sugreeva, for my enterprise called search for 
Seetha is under his aegis, isn't it... [3-75-8b, 9a]


To that brave Rama who is speaking thus, Soumitri said this, " my heart too is hastening me, let us 
go there promptly..." [3-75-9b, 10a]


Then that Lord of People and Lord of Nature on exiting from that hermitage, he then came nigh of Lake 
Pampa along with Lakshmana. [3-75-10b, 11a]


Rama on scrutinising that rosy woodland in which everywhere there are outsized and diverse trees that 
are thickset with flowers, and different lakes loaded with the trilling birds like plovers, peacocks, 
waterfowls and suchlike, with which that woodland itself is trilling in much ado, became impassioned 
as he is instantly rendered thus by Love-god, and thus that Rama went towards that lovely Lake Pampa. 
[3-75-11b, 12, 13]


Rama spotted Pampa Lake from a distance which is plethoric with water, but entered into a lake called 
Matanga Lake on his way to Pampa... [3-75-14]


Though both Raghava-s came there composedly and dispassionately, but Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is 
ensorcelled by anguish on seeing a ladylike lake Pampa. [3-75-15]


Rama entered the area of that beautiful lake which is beaming forth with lotuses hemming in from inside, 
and trees like Tilaka, Ashoka, Punnaga, Bakula, Uddala, are hemming it from outside. [3-75-16]


That lake is huddled with delightful fringe lands and lotuses squeeze it from within, and its water 
is plethoric and crystalline, and its sand is softish all over. [3-75-17]


That lake is beautified with packs of fishes and tortoises, and packs of trees on its banks, on which 
climber plants are wraparound like the ladyloves of those trees. [3-75-18]


And that is adored by the beings like sylvan, reptilian, celestial, georgic, and elfish beings, and 
it is overcrowded with trees and tendrils, and it is a trove for fairish and clodish water. [3-75-19]


The lotuses of the lake are rich in their fragrance, and with the heaps of clusters of reddish, whitish, 
and blackish lotuses, and with such pinkish, whitish, and reddish lotuses the sheet of water is like 
a picturesquely painted canvas and it is surrounded by the orchards of flowered mango trees and sounded 
much by the screams of peacocks. [3-75-20, 21]


Then Rama along with Lakshmana on seeing at that Pampa Lake, that self-refulgent son of Dasharatha whimpered 
over, owing to his passionate recollection of Seetha. [3-75-22]


That Pampa Lake is wraparound with the trees of Tilaka, Citron-fruits, Banyan, White-trees, likewise 
flowered are flowery trees like Red oleanders, Punnaaga, shrubs of Maalati and Kunda, likewise flowered 
are the trees of Madder, Nicula, Ashoka, and Seven-leaved banana plants, and plants of Mogra and climbers 
of Maadhavii Lata are also flowered, and with them she that Ladylike Pampa shone forth like a pulchritudinous 
lady. [3-75-23, 24]


The aforesaid mountain renowned as Rishyamuka which is abounding with colourful ores and amazingly flowered 
trees is there on the bank of Pampa Lake. [3-75-25b, 26a]


A noble soul by his name Risharaja was there and that monkey's son is the highly valiant Sugreeva, thus 
he is renowned, and he presides over that mountain. [3-75-26b, 27b]


That best one among men Rama, said this way, "oh, Lakshmana, you make a headway for that chief of monkeys, 
Sugreeva..." and further said this to Lakshmana whose valiance is truthfulness alone, "how can I possibly 
live without Seetha..." [3-75-27b, 28]


Such as he is whose thinking is applying itself to Seetha alone, and who is vocalising his anguish for 
her, to whom aa stymie is laid by the Love-god just at the appearance that lake, that Rama on saying 
that sentence in that way to Lakshmana neared that superb and heart delighting lotus Lake Pampa. [3-75-29]


On going step by step, and on going on seeing ardently and intently at that forest which has picturesque 
visuals of forestry, and which is with hurly-burly birds, not one, but numerous and divers are they, 
and then Rama along with Lakshmana on entering the area of that lake, has seen that Lake Pampa. [3-75-30]

When Seetha spoke thus Ravana is embittered, and knitting his eyebrows he indeed spoke these rudish 
words to Seetha. [3-48-1]


"I am known as Ravana, oh, lady with superb complexion, let safety betide you, the highly valorous and 
ten-headed stepbrother of Kubera. [3-48-2]


"I am that Ravana at whose sight all the gods together with gandharva-s, evil-spirits, birds and snakes 
will always be frightened and fleeing, as with the people frightened and fleeing from death. [3-48-3]


"I am that Ravana who when infuriated for some other reason took up a duel with Kubera, his brother 
from stepparent, wherein that Kubera is set up against and completely trounced in a combat. [3-48-4]


"I am that Ravana by whom Kubera, the god for Wealth-Management whose vehicular transport is handled 
by humans, is tormented fearfully and made to completely abandon his wealthiest place which is presided 
over by him till then, and I am the one who made that Kubera to flee to the excellent Mt. Kailash where 
he is somehow living, because I will not cause any harm on Mt. Kailash as I hold it sacred. [3-48-5]


"I am that Ravana, oh, auspicious lady, who just by his valour acquired Kubera's auspicious aircraft 
known as Pushpaka, whose pilotage is just by the wish of its aviator, with which I will be travelling 
in skies. [3-48-6]


"Just by seeing rancour-shot face of mine, oh, Maithili, all the gods will quickly shoot off, even if 
Indra is leading them, then where is the question of their confronting me. [3-48-7]


"Where I will be staying there the Air-god wafts doubtfully, lest his gusts and blasts may hurt me, 
and the Sun also effectuates his singeing sunbeams as cooling moonbeams, lest I may abduct his wife 
Prabha, the Sunshine. [3-48-8]


"At places where I will be staying or freely moving there the leaves of trees will be less of rustle, 
lest I may wilt them up, and there the gush of water of rivers too will quieten, lest I may dry them 
up. [3-48-9]


"My magnificent city known as Lanka is there on the other shore of the ocean, plethoric with all kinds 
of amenities, as well as with ghastly demons, which city will be on par with Indra's Amaravati, but 
for meekly gods and meaningless souls. [3-48-10]


"That gorgeous city is completely walled in with compound walls that are adorned with whitish silver, 
and its palace-chambers are golden, and its archways are fully jewelled with lapis jewels. [3-48-11]


"It is encumbered with elephants, horses and chariots, well sounded by the sounds of trumpets, and with 
trees which yield fruits that fulfil all the savours, and it is bedecked with chirrupy pleasure-gardens. 
[3-48-12]


"Oh, princess, oh, self-respectful lady, if you reside there together with me, hè, Seetha, then you 
will not think of yourself as one from among human females. [3-48-13]


"Revelling in humanly luxuries, over and beyond in heavenly luxuries also, you will not recollect humanly 
Rama, whose longevity is lessened. [3-48-14]


"Though Rama is the eldest son, king Dasharatha established his dear son Bharata as king, and because 
Rama is spineless he is put to flight to forests, and now, what is he and what am I, in matter of sovereignty. 
[3-48-15]


"Rama is subverted from kingdom, thus dwindled is valour, thus winded down is his anima, thus he has 
become a pitiable one, thus he became an ascetic as nothing else is there for him to undertake, oh, 
broad-eyed lady, what do you aspire to do with such a Rama? [3-48-16]


"I, the king of all the demons, am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came to you in love, and instead 
of beseeching me to love you, your rejection and speaking this way, is unapt of you.


"Although I am the king of all the demons, on seeing you I am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came 
to you, thus you love me... but rejecting me this way is unapt of you, as you alone will be loosing 
heavenly comforts, if you reject me. [3-48-17]


"Oh, modest lady, on refusing me you surely become remorseful like Uurvashi who once kicked Puruurava 
with her feet. [3-48-18]


"He that Rama is merely a human, and in war he equals me not by my finger, oh, richly colourful lady, 
and I chanced here merely by your serendipity, thus you honour me and my desire to possess you..." Thus 
Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-48-19]


Vaidehi who is spoken thus is infuriated on her part and with her eyes bloodshot spoke these bitter 
words to the king of demons in that lonely lace. [3-48-20]


"How you wish to commit sins although saying that Kubera, a god reverenced by all of the gods, is your 
brother? [3-48-21]


"All the demons will perforce get completely destroyed, oh, Ravana, for whom you the cruel and culpable 
one with uncontrolled senses is the king, and you will be blameworthy for the elimination of righteous 
demons like Vibheeshana, et al. [3-48-22]


"It may be possible to live after abducting Shaci Devi, the wife of Indra, somehow and anyhow there 
will be no liveability after abducting me, the wife of Rama. [3-48-23]


"Oh, demon, un-mirrored is the prettiness of prettyish Shaci Devi, and one may live long on forcibly 
snatching her away from the hands of the wielder of Thunderbolt, Indra, but to him who intimidates or 
abuses me or women like me, there will be no <strong>moksha</strong>, release from the cycle of rebirth, 
even if he has consumed <strong>amR^ita</strong> ambrosia." Thus Seetha spoke to Ravana. [3-48-24]

"Give attention to my words as I speak, oh, sire, Maareecha, I am an anguished one,
and when I am in such an anguish you are the ultimate course to me, isn't so." Thus Ravana started
addressing Maareecha. [3-36-1]


"You are aware as to how my brother Khara, and the mighty armed Duushana, also my
sister Shuurpanakha, and even the highly fiery demon and devourer of raw-flesh Trishira, and even
numerous other night-walking demons who are cocksure of hitting their targets have made Janasthaana
as their residency, and while residing there they put the sages of that great forest that tread a
righteous path to torture, of course, all this as assigned by me. [3-36-2, 3, 4]


"You are equally aware of the stationing fourteen thousand braving demons in
Janasthaana, who are the followers of the wish of Khara, who are with fiendish exploits, and who
are the troublemakers to the sages of Dandaka forest or to the intruders therein, aren't you.
[3-36-5]


"But recently those great mighty demons that are the residents of Janasthaana,
namely Khara and others, preparing themselves inordinately and wielding diverse weapons and
assaulters, for their part had an encounter with Rama in a combat. [3-36-6, 7a]


"With rancour tiding in him, and without making any scathing remark in the least,
that Rama brought his bow into play with arrows in the van of the combat. [3-36-7b, 8a]


"But that foot-soldier, that too, a human, has completely wiped out those
fourteen-thousand demons with flaring fieriness with his fierce arrows. [3-36-8b, 9a]


"Khara is hewed down, Duushana is mowed down, and even Trishira is hacked down,
thereof that Dandaka forest is rendered free from the fear of demons. [3-36-9b, 10a]


"He who is put to flight by his infuriated father, and who came to Dandaka forest
along with his wife, that ignoble Kshatriya is the slaughterer of that demonic army of mine, as his
lifespan is diminished. [3-36-10b, 11a]


"He is out of character, brutal, firestorm, senseless, selfish, one with his senses
unconquered and righteousness discarded, and he is an unrighteous soul just delighting in the
disservice of all beings. [3-36-11b, 12a]


"By whom my sister is disfigured stripping off her nose and ears, that too, without
any enmity but just depending upon his own brawn, I would like to inveigle such a man's nymphean
wife Seetha holding sway on her in Janasthaana, and in that matter I want you to be my aide in
Dandaka forest. [3-36-12b, 13, 14a]


"Oh, highly powerful Maareecha, with you and with my brothers standing by my side as
my associates, I indeed care a damn for all of the gods if they are going to wage a war against me,
therefore, oh, demon Maareecha, as you are capable of rendering aid you should indeed become my
aide in this venture. [3-36-14b, 15]


"In valour, war and verve there is none similar to you, you are a topmost stalwart
in trickery, and a matchless expert in illusive-tricks. [3-36-16]


"I have come nigh of you only for that reason, oh, nightwalker, and listen to that
deed which you have to do in the course of helping me as I detail you. [3-36-17]


"On becoming an astounding golden deer with silver dots, you move in front of Seetha
in the hermitage of that Rama. [3-36-18]


"On seeing you in the shape of a deer, Seetha undoubtedly bids her husband
forthwith, and even Lakshmana, saying, 'lay hold of it.' [3-36-19]


"Then on the diversion of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, I will comfortably and
unimpededly abduct Seetha in that lonely place, as planet Rahu abducts the shine of moon.
[3-36-20]


"Thereafter Rama will be enervated by the abduction of his wife, and then surely and
conveniently I wish to retaliate him if he is going to come up against me, for my inner-soul will
be firstly gratified with its volition, namely possessing Seetha." Thus Ravana requested Maareecha.
[3-36-21]


On listening the very word of Rama that honest-souled Maareecha's mouth is
completely dried up, and he is fully frightened. [3-36-22]


Wetting dried up lips with his tongue he has become goggle-eyed almost like an
about-to-die animal, and he agonisingly looked up at Ravana with winkless eyes. [3-36-23]


Maareecha's heart sank with scare as he is aware of Rama's valour when he was in the
great forest of Tataka, thus suppliantly making palm-fold he started telling about factuality of
Rama to Ravana, which is beneficial both to Ravana and to himself, as well, if only Ravana is
heedful of it. [3-36-24]

Rama along with Soumitri is well revered by Sage Suteekhsna, spent that night there and awoken in the 
morning. [3-8-1]


Rama got up according to time along with Seetha and touched finely cool water with lotus-fragrance for 
morning bath. [3-8-2]


Then they all, Vaidehi, Rama and Lakshmana, on worshipping sacred fire and deities dutifully in the 
shelter of the sages in that forest and on seeing the dawning sun, they are reft of their blemishes, 
and then they approached Sage Suteekshna speaking this sentence gently. [3-8-3, 4]


"We stayed here happily, oh, god, venerated by a venerable one like you, and here we come to ask your 
permission as we wish to journey on, as the sages are hastening us... [3-8-5]


"We make haste to see the habitats of hermitages in their entirety, and even wish to see the sages with 
meritorious selves living in Dandaka forest... [3-8-6]


"We wish to have your permission, and that of these eminent sages, who are ever virtuous, self-controlled 
by their ascesis, and who look like the veritable tongues of sacred fire... [3-8-7]


"We wish to proceed before sun attains an intolerable glare, like an unworthy person of unworthy lineage 
attains wealth in an improper way with much glare..." saying so Rama with Seetha and Lakshmana venerated 
at the feet of that sage Suteekshna. [3-8-8, 9]


That eminent sage lifted them that are touching his feet, embraced them tightly, and said this sentence 
in all his friendliness. [3-8-10]


"Proceed in an invulnerable way, Rama, along with Lakshmana, and with this Seetha while she follows 
you closely like a shadow... [3-8-11]


"See the pleasant thresholds of the hermitages of the dwellers in the forests of Dandaka, oh! Valiant 
one, whose souls are consecrated just by their ascesis... [3-8-2]


"See the well-flowered woodlands with well-grown fruits and tubers, with herds of best animals and 
peaceful bird flocks... tranquil waters with spreading clusters of bloomed lotuses and water-birds in 
the pools and lakes... eye-pleasing rapids from mountains and you can see pleasant forests loaded with 
the hearty screams of precooks... [3-8-13, 14, 15]


"My dear Rama, you may go and Soumitri you too also may go... but come again towards this hermitage 
after seeing all of them... [3-8-16]


Thus said by the sage, Rama in his turn said to him, "so be it..." and having performed circumambulations 
around the sage he started to journey on. [3-8-17]


Then the broad eyed Seetha gave auspicious quivers and bows to those brothers and then spotless swords 
too. [3-8-18]


Both of those two Rama and Lakshmana tied their beautiful quivers well on their backs, and took the 
twangy bows and exited from that hermitage to go on their way. [3-8-19]


Those two Raghava-s, the handsome princes, have swiftly set out when permitted by that august sage, 
wielding bows and swords, and along with Seetha. [3-8-20]

On hearing all of the words said by Vaidehi, in adoration of her husband, he who abides by virtue alone 
that Rama replied Janaki. [4-10-1]


"You have said beneficial, friendlily words that are seemlier to your disposition, oh, lady, which 
are apt to speak of your familial brought up, for you are the daughter of virtue-knowing Janaka. [4-10-2]


"What more shall I say, oh, lady, since it is said that 'a warrior handles a bow so that misery's tears 
cease to flow...' and this saying is iterated even by you... [4-10-3]


"Oh! Seetha, those shleterable sages of Dandaka forest have approached me sombrely on their own, and 
thus they came into my refuge... [4-10-4]


"Subsisting on fruits and tubers, living at all the time in forests those sages are not getting quietude, 
as they are scared by the demons with invidious deeds... [4-10-5]


"The sages dwelling in Dandaka forest are being eaten away by fiendish demons that subsist on human 
flesh, and while being eaten away like that those eminent Brahmans have said to me, "please come to 
our rescue..." [4-10-6,7a]


"This way when I have heard the words voiced by them, I comforted them verbally and avouched this way, 
"Be gracious to me... you all... by which reason I am being addressed this way by this kind of eminent 
Brahmans, whom I should have actually addressed my self, this indeed is a dishonour for me... [4-10-7b, 
8, 9a]


"Then I said before the Brahmans, "what shall I do?" All of them thus thronged and spoke this word. 
[4-10-9b, 10a]


"Many of the guise changing demons are outrightly torturing us in Dandaka forest, hence in that context 
you shall protect us... [4-10-10b, 11a]


"Those resistless carnivorous demons, oh, merited Rama, will descend exactly at the time of fire oblations, 
or on propitious times like full or new moons to persecute us... [4-10-11b, 12a]


"We the ascetics being assaulted thus are aggrieved, and when we searched for a recourse you chanced 
as our ultimate course... [4-10-12b, 13a]


"We by the efficacy of our ascesis are surely capable to eradicate those demons, but we do not wish 
to shorten the effect of our long earned merit of ascesis... [4-10-13b, 14a]


"Many hurdles are always there in our practice of ascesis, and even the ascesis have become impracticable, 
oh, Raghava, thus though being eaten away by the demons we are not issuing any curse... [4-10-14b, 15a]


"Thereby, you along with your brother protect us that are being persecuted by the demons dwelling in 
Dandaka forest as you alone are the protector of ours in these forests...'so said sages to me... [4-10-15b, 
16a]


"On hearing all those words, oh, Seetha, I promised complete protection to the sages of Dandaka forests... 
[4-10-16b, 17a]


"Having promised to the sages it is incapable of me to implement it otherwise while I am alive... truth 
is dearer to me, isn't it... [4-10-17b, 18a]


"I may forfeit my life, forgo Lakshmana, or even forsake you but not a promise, that too especially 
made to Brahmans, and having promised I can never go back... [4-10-18b, 19a]


"By that reason, oh, Seetha, even if I am unasked, safeguarding sages is definitely to be done by me, 
how then it is undone when given a promise... [4-10-19b, 20a]


"With your friendship and good-heartedness you say these words, oh, Seetha, I am contended... uninterested 
ones do not forewarn, indeed... [4-10-20b, 21a]


"Appropriate and seemly is your word of caution to your bloodline, oh, graceful Seetha, you are the 
co-pursuer in dharma with me, hence you are loftier to me than my own lives..." So said Rama to Seetha. 
[4-10-21b, c]


That exalted soul Rama on saying those words to Seetha, his dear wife and the daughter of Janaka, wielding 
his bow proceeded further with Lakshmana to the picturesque woodlands of hermits. [4-10-22]

On prying at those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who are completely stowed in the hangman's halter-like 
arms of the demon, and who are enduring within it, Kabandha said this sentence to them. [3-70-1]


"Oh, excellent Kshatriya-s, on seeing me who am miserably famished, really what for you stay cool? You 
are the godsend gobs of mine, and hence now you are almost dead..." So said Kabandha to brothers. [3-70-2]


Lakshmana who is possessed by anguish, and who is determined to wreck revenge on that demon, said these 
expedient and advisable words to Rama on hearing that demon's word. [3-70-3]


"This scurrilous demon quickly hauled in you and me to his face level, and he will quickly take us in, 
therefore, we will have to swiftly hack off his lengthy arms at his shoulder level... [3-70-4]


"Gruesome is this gargantuan bodied demon, and triumphing over just with his arms he has utterly devastated 
this province, and he now wishes to end us... [3-70-5]


"Oh, king Raghava, killing the non-aggressive is tantamount to the killing of animals that are led into 
Vedic-ritual in its midst is despicable to the kings... [3-70-6]


On hearing all of their conversation that demon is infuriated, and then widely opening his ferocious 
mouth he started to wolf down both of them. [3-70-7]


Then both the Raghava-s are very highly gladdened as the demon is hauling them towards his eye at shoulder 
level, and as they are the brothers with circumspection, they instantly mutilated his arms right at 
their shoulder joints only with two swords. [3-70-8]


Then that dextrous Rama with an unrestrained speed hacked off the right arm, and valiant Lakshmana on 
his part hewed down the left arm that speedily. [3-70-9]


He that overlong-armed Kabandha fell down with mangled arms, reverberated the sky, earth, and all of 
the ten points of horizon with a cacophonous voice, like a black-thunderous-cloud. [3-70-10]


That demon on seeing at his dissevered shoulders on which the gushes of blood are overflowing, he self-piteously 
asked those two bold ones thus as, "who are you..." [3-70-11]


When that great mighty Kabandha is asking thus, Lakshmana who has prosperous characteristics has informed 
him about Rama of Kakutstha, an unremitting dynasty. [3-70-12]


"He is known to people by the name of Rama, the legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty, and you know me as his 
younger brother, Lakshmana, by my name... [3-70-13]


"Countervailed from kingdom by mother this Rama is bluntly sent to forests, and he is on the rove in 
great forests along with me ad his wife... [3-70-14]


"A demon stole his wife while he whose leverage is like that of god is living in the unpopulated forest... 
and wishing to retrieve her we came here... [3-70-15]


"But who are you? Your legs are broken, and your mouth is infernal, yet it is on your chest, and alike 
a topless, rootless tree trunk you are sprawling in the forest, how so, or, for what reason?" Lakshmana 
asked the demon thus. [3-70-16]


But Kabandha is highly delighted when Lakshmana spoke that way, as the words of Indra came to his memory, 
and he said these words in reply. [3-70-17]


"Oh, manly tigers, by my providence you are revealed to me... welcome to you... and providentially sheared 
are these shackles, called my two arms, by you... [3-70-18]


"Oh, manly tiger, actually how this form of mine is disfigured, of course owing to my distrustful behaviour, 
that you may listen while I narrate it to you. [3-70-19]

Lakshmana on seeing Rama who is searing and careworn owing to the abduction of
Seetha, blazing like the doomsday inferno, twinned with the notion of rendering the worlds into
nonentity, kenning at his stringed bow, keen to blaze away entire universe, suspiring again and
again, and who is alike Rudra at the end of era, and whose highly infuriated persona Lakshmana has
not seen previously, became pale-faced and spoke to Rama with folded palms. [3-65-1]


"Previously, you were self-collected and self-controlled and delighted in the
wellbeing of all the beings. But presently, slipping into fury you are discarding your own
disposition, which is unapt of you... [3-65-4]


"Grandeur in moon, splendour in sun, motion in wind, and composure in earth are
perpetual and all this perpetuity is available in you, besides an unexcelled honour... [3-65-5]


"It will be unapt of you to vandalise worlds for a single-soul's felony. It is
unclear as to whose combat-chariot is this, or by whom, or by what reason it is shattered with its
weaponry and paraphernalia... [3-65-6, 7a]


"This has become a very ghastly place since it is grooved by the hooves of ungulates
and by the felloies of chariot-wheels, and it is wetted with drops of blood, oh, prince, thereby a
combat is fought and stalled at this place... [3-65-7b, 8a]


"This is just a solo-combatant's combat but not among duo, oh, best articulator one
among best articulators, I indeed observe that no huge army is eventuated here, nor its stamp...
[3-65-8b, 9a]


"It will be inapt of you to wish for wrecking a havoc upon all worlds for an
individual's wrongdoing. Why because, the good-hearted, good-natured kings are they who impose
tenable punishment... [3-65-9b, 10a]


"You are always the shelterer for all beings, for you're above all the good-natured
and good-hearted ordinary kings, and who can really deem the ravagement of you wife as an act of
grace... [3-65-10b, 11a]


"As no altruist can evoke indignation in a hallowed person who is performing
Vedic-ritual, honestly, these rivers, oceans, mountains, gods, celestials, and cacodemons too
cannot evoke indignation in you, because they are always gentle to you... isn't so... [3-65-10b,
11a]


"Oh, king, it will be apt of you to wield your bow and search for him who abducted
Seetha, along with me as your squire and standby, and with the help of sublime sages available in
this forest... [3-65-12b, 13a]


"Let us search the oceans, rivers and forests, and even divers dreadful caves and
different lotus-lakes... [3-65-13b, 14a]


"Let us intently search the worlds of gods and celestials as long as the abductor of
your wife is unapprehended... [3-65-14b, 15a]


"Oh, Lord of Kosala kingdom, if the heavenly lords are not going bestow your wife
propitiously, rather after our humanly effort, then you may do whatever you want, seasonably...
[3-65-15b, c]


"If, oh, king, you with your traits of sincerity, solidarity, simplicity, and
scrupulosity are not going to get back Seetha, then you may you may put whole of the universe to
turmoil with the torrents of your arrows which have swift egress as they are with golden-handles
which are stuffed with eagle feathers, and which mirror up the Thunderbolts of Mahendra in their
trajectories..." Thus Lakshmana appealed to ireful Rama. [3-65-16]

Then while proceeding to Panchavati that Rahu's descendent came across a mammoth eagle with marvellous 
might in midway. [3-14-1]


On seeing such an eagle in the forest those two highly privileged brothers Rama and Lakshmana questioned 
it asking, "Who you are?" presuming it to be a demon. [3-14-2]


But that eagle with sweet ad soft words spoke to them as though to please them, "oh boy Rama know me 
as your father's friend." [3-14-3]


Accepting that bird as his father's friend Raghava revered it, and he that Rama then asked for that 
eagle's name and lineage. [3-14-4]


On hearing Rama's words that bird said about his ancestry and himself, and in doing so, that eagle also 
narrated the overall genesis of all beings. [3-14-5]


"Once upon a time there were lords of people, oh dextrous Raghava, and you may listen all about them 
from the beginning, while I narrate [3-14-6]


"Of them Kardama was there at first, and afterwards Sesha, and later Samshraya was there with many children 
and a vigorous one he was. Then Sthaanu, Mariichi, Atri, the great mighty one Kratu, Pulasthya, Angira, 
Pracheta and Pulah were there. And oh, Raghava, Daksha, Vivaswan were while the other name of Vivasvan 
is Arishtanemi, and lastly the great resplendent Kashyapa, was there as Prajapati. [3-14-9] [3-14-7]


"Oh glorious Rama, there were sixty highly renowned daughters to Daksha, thus we hear. [3-14-10]


"Of them Kashyapa accepted eight slender-waisted daughters of Daksha Prajapati, namely Aditi, Diti, 
Danu, Kaalakaa and Taamra, Krodhavasha, also thus Manu and even Anala also as wives. [3-14-11, 12a]


"Then Kashyapa is gladdened and said to those young wives, "You all shall deliver sons similar to me 
and who can sustain the three worlds." [3-14-12b, 13a]


"Oh, dextrous Rama, Aditi, Diti, Kaalakaa and Danu have agreed for that, but others became unheedful 
of Kashyapa's words. [3-14-13b, 14a]


"Aditi gave birth to twelve Aditya-s, the Sun-gods, eight Vasu-s, the Terrestrials-gods, eleven Rudraa-s, 
the Fury-gods, and two Ashvinis, the medicine-gods, total thirty-three of them. [3-14-14b, 15a]


"Oh, boy Rama, Diti gave birth to well-known Daitya-s, the so-called demons, and earlier this earth 
with forests and oceans belonged to them. [3-14-15b, 16a]


"And oh, enemy-destroyer Rama, Danu gave birth to son Ashvagriiva or also called Hayagriiva, Horse-headed 
god, and Kaalakaa gave birth to Naraka and Kaalaka. [3-14-16b, 17a]


"But Taamraa gave birth to five world renowned girls namely, Krounchi, Bhaasii, Shyenii, Dhritaraashtrii, 
and Shukii. [3-14-17b, 18a]


"And from each of the five daughters of Taamraa in turn emanated are the other avian species, where 
Kraunchii gave birth to Uluuka-s, the owls, Bhasii-s gave birth to Bhaasaa-s, the vultures, and Shyenii 
gave birth to very sharp eagles and falcons, and then Dhritaraashtrii gave birth to swans and all other 
kinds of graceful water-birds. [3-14-18b, 19]


"Dhritaraashtrii gave birth even to Chakravaaka water-birds, and Shukii gave birth to a daughter Nata, 
and Nata's daughter is Vinata. [3-14-20]


"Oh, Rama, Krodhavasha gave birth to ten of her self-same daughters namely Mrigi, Mrigamanda, Hari, 
Bhadramanda, Maatangii, Sharduulii, Shweta, Surabhii, and like that to Surasa, who is embodied with 
all giftedness, and even to Kadruva. [3-14-21, 22]


"Children Mrigi are all of the the deer, oh best of the best-men, Rama, and Mrigamnda's progeny is Riksha-s, 
Bears, a kind of antelope, and like that the Himalayan yak like species.[3-14-23]


"Then Bhadramanda gave birth to the girl named Iravati and her son is elephant the great, Airaavata, 
the protector of world. [3-14-24]


"And Hari's offspring are lions and sagely/mighty monkeys, while Sharduulii gave birth to baboons and 
tigers. [3-14-25]


"Then Maatangi's childrenm are elephants, oh, best one among men, Rama, and Shweta gave birth to eight 
elephants that are at eight quarters of world, sustaining the world on their head. [3-14-26]


"Then, oh Rama, Surabhi gave birth to two daughters, one is named as illustrious Rohini, safe you 
be, and the other is Gandharvi. [3-14-27]


"Rohini gave birth to cows and other livestock, while Surasa gave birth to Naagaa-s, viz., many headed 
serpents, while Kadru gave birth to ordinary serpents. [3-124-28]


"Oh, the best among men Rama, the wife of great-soul Kashyapa, lady Manu procreated humans, Brahman--s, 
Kshatriya-s, Vyasya-s, and Shudra-s. [3-14-29]


"The Brahman-s emerged from face, the Kshatriya-s from chest, the Vyasya-s from two thighs, and the 
Shudra-s from two feet, thus we hear from the scriptures viz., Veda, i.e., Rig Veda Purusha Shuukta. 
[3-14-30]


"All the merited fruit-bearing trees are given birth by Anala, and now I will narrate about Vinata, 
the daughter's daughter of Shukii, and about Kadru, the sister of Surasa. [3-14-31]


"Kadru gave birth to a thousand-headed serpent who is the bearer of this earth, and Vinata gave birth 
to two sons namely Garuda and Aruna. [3-14-32]


"Oh enemy-destroyer Rama, I took birth from that Aruna, the charioteer of Sun, and my elder brother 
Sampati too, hence know me as Jatayu, the son of Shyenii. [3-14-33]


"Such as I am, I can be your helpmate at your residence if only you wish me to... oh, boy, this impassable 
forest is a beloved one to predators and demons, isn't it... as such I can take care of Seetha if you 
and Lakshmana go out..." Thus Jatayu said to Rama. [3-14-34]


Raghava revered Jatayu in his turn by gladly hugging and stood by him with his head bent, and that kind-natured 
Rama is indeed regardful of the friendship of his father with Jatayu that is repeatedly said by Jatayu. 
[3-14-35]


He that Rama took the princess from Mithila Seetha, and proceeded to Panchavati along with that very 
mighty bird and Lakshmana, as though to incinerate enemies, like fire that burns down grasshoppers.

Rama then voicing clearly and softly spoke to her, whom the noose of lust has tethered down, with a 
smile preceding his words. [3-18-1]


"Oh, honourable one, I am married and this is my dear wife, thus it will be distressing for your sort 
of females to live with a co-wife. [3-18-2]


"He is my younger brother named Lakshmana, he is with a good conduct, good looking, a promising and 
valiant one, and he is without a wife. [3-18-3]


"He is without a wife and in need of a wife  he is youthful, good-looking and he can become a fitly 
husband of yours, fit enough to your kind of features. [3-18-4]


"You woo him, oh, board-eyed [bulged-eyed] one, this brother of mine as your husband like sunshine seeking 
the Mt. Meru, then oh, great-waisted [pot-bellied] one, you will be without a co-wife " So said Rama 
to that demoness. [3-18-5]


When Rama clearly told that way to that demoness dazed in lust, discarding Rama quickly then she spoke 
to Lakshmana. [3-18-6]


"I with my best complexion will be your deserving wife meetly to you charm, you can happily take a jaunt 
all over Dandaka forest along with me." So Shuurpanakha ran after Lakshmana. [3-18-7]


Thus said by the demoness that meaningful sentence maker Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, then smiled 
and appropriately replied Shuurpanakha. [3-18-8]


"How you wish to become a female servant, oh, [black] lotus-coloured one, by becoming the wife of a 
servant like me? I am just a vassal of my adorable brother. [3-18-9]


"Oh, goggle eyed one, befitting to your complexion that is un-stainable further you better become the 
wife of my brother Rama who is abounding in means, and on becoming the younger wife of that adorable 
one, you too will achieve your means and thus you will be happy. [3-18-10]


"On discarding her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolically deleterious old wife with a hallow stomach 
that Rama will adore you alone. [3-18-11]


"Oh, best complexioned one with best waist, is there any wiseacre to simply discard your kind of best 
personality, indeed, in preference to human females?" Lakshmana said so to Shuurpanakha. [3-18-12]


Thus said by Lakshmana that despicable one with slouching stomach Shuurpanakha presumed those words 
to be truthful, for she is equivocal of that equivoque. [3-18-13]


She who is fuddle by lust said to that unassailable enemy scorcher Rama who is sitting in the cottage 
along with Seetha. [3-18-14]


"Tenacious of her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolical, hallow-stomached old wife of yours you are 
not regarding me high. [3-18-15]


"Now I wish to eat up this human female right before your very eyes, and then I can blithely make merry 
along with you, without the botheration of a co-wife." Said Shuurpanakha to Rama. [3-18-16]


Speaking that way she that torch-eyed Shuurpanakha dashed towards the deer-eyed Seetha in high exasperation 
as a great meteor would dash towards Rohini, the brightest star in the sky. [3-18-17]


By that the great-energetic Rama took umbrage and checking her who is like the noose of death swooping 
down on Seetha said to Lakshmana. [3-18-18]


"Punning in any way with the base and brutish is inapposite, oh, gentle Saumitri, mark note of Vaidehi, 
somehow surviving  [3-18-19]


"She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this 
paunchy demoness " Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [3-18-20]


Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before 
the very eyes of Rama. [3-18-21]


On hewing off her ears and nose she that ghastly Shuurpanakha blared highly and discordantly, and very 
speedily fled into forest as she came. [3-18-22]


She that very ghastly demoness when defaced is wetted by blood and blared many a blare like a cloud 
in cloudburst. [3-18-23]


She that gruesome one in her appearance clasped herself and thunderously entered similarly gruesome 
forest while her blood fountained and profusely exuded. [3-18-24]


Then she who is deformed neared her brother Khara who possess violent vigour, who is abiding in Janasthaana 
and who is presently surrounded by his band of his hench-demons, and before him she that Shuurpanakha 
fell onto ground like a thunderbolt from the sky. [3-18-25]


Then that sister of Khara who is convulsed in the fluster of fear and her body wetted with blood reported 
to her brother Khara, all about Rama's arrival in forest with his wife and Lakshmana, and even about 
his misshaping her. [3-18-26]

Vaidehi has not seen any rescuer while she is abducted, but she has seen five
prominent vanara-s staying on a mountaintop. [3-54-1]


That broad-eyed and curvaceous lady with resentment Seetha, inwrapping her
auspicious ornaments in the upper-fringe of her sari, dropped in the midmost of those five Vanara-s
with a thinking that 'these creatures may perhaps indicate them to Rama.' [3-54-2, 3a]


On his part that Decahedron Ravana has not noticed her action in whipping up her
silky upper-cloth and ornaments, their bundling and stowing away at five vanara-s, owing to his own
hurry. [3-54-3]


Those ochreish-eyed best Vanara-s with their unwinking eyes have observed the
broad-eyed Seetha, who at that time is verily wailing. [3-54-4b, 5a]


The chief of demons Ravana captivating Maithili, who is still wailing, has crossed
the Pampa region down underneath and advanced facing the City of Lanka. [3-54-5b, 6a]


Ravana is jubilantly happy in stealing his own death alias Seetha, as one would
carry a stingingly fanged and lethally venomous she-snake in his own lap. [3-54-6b, 7a]


He bolted out in skyway up above the woodlands, waterways, pools, and mountains at
the double, as with an arrow bolting from a bow. [3-4-7b, 8a]


On reaching the ocean, a housing for sharks, alligators, a home of Rain-god, a
never-draining deep and an ultimate course of the rivers, he hastily crossed it over. [3-54-8b,
9a]


That ocean being the abode of Rain-god is highly flustered when Vaidehi is being
abducted over it, and its waves became topsy-turvy and its fishes and great marine-reptiles
remained shilly-shally. [3-54-9b, 10a]


Then the siddha-s and caarana-s available in airspace averred saying, "this alone is
the end of Decahedron Ravana." [3-54-10b, 11a]


Ravana entered the city of Lanka transporting Seetha, while she wriggling in his
flank, who appeared like the personified death of Ravana wriggling its way into his Lanka.
[3-54-11b, 12a]


On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, then he entered
his own palace-chambers which is with very many doors and chambers thronging with crowds.


On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, he then entered
his own palace chambers in which royal servants are thronging at many doorways as that palace has
very many chambers. [3-54-12b, 13a]


Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in
bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya once kept his
lady-love, a nymphet called Hema, in a demonic Black Hole.


Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in
bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya kept his demonic
power in a Black Hole.


Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in
bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya had once kept al his
demonic scriptures duly usurping them from his own mentor, namely Shukracaarya, at an unknown
illusory place. [3-54-13b, 14a]


That Decahedron Ravana also instructed the bogey-sightly bogeywomen, "your watch and
ward shall be in such a way that neither a female nor a male can see Seetha impermissibly."
[3-54-14b, 15a]


"Whatever she wishes to have, gold, jewels, pearls, apparels or adornments, they all
be given to her as you would give me according to my whimsies. [3-54-15b, 16a]


"Whosoever speaks unpleasant words to Vaidehi in the least, either unknowingly or
knowingly, her life becomes unpleasant for herself." Thus Ravana ordered the chamber-demonesses.
[3-54-16b, 17a]


On speaking to those demonesses thus that chief of demons exited from that palace
chamber, and giving a thought to what is to be done in sequel, then he gave audience to eight
highly vigorous demons, the feasters on raw-flesh. [3-54-17b, 18]


He who is egocentric by the boon awarded by Brahma for his invincibleness, that
Ravana on giving an audience to those eight demons spoke this sentence to them praiseful of their
might and valour. [3-54-19]


"You immediately take up multiple assaultive weaponry and begone from here to
Janasthaana speedily, a place now deadpanned for demons, which earlier was the placement of Khara.
[3-54-20]


"Throwaway your fright faraway and you stay in that Janasthaana which fell void as
the demons are voided by someone called Rama, and there you shall stay self-assuredly and
self-confidently. [3-54-21]


"Though highly forceful forces are deployed in Janasthaana, Rama's arrows have
utterly destroyed them, together with Khara and Duushana. [3-54-22]


"Thereby an unprecedented fury is escalating over and above my courage, and an
unhindered and unforgivable animosity towards that Rama is evoked in me. [3-54-23]


"I wish to cast out my begrudging against my enemy who bears a grudge against me,
and indeed, to me 'sleep' is not the word for it, until my enemy is undone in a war. [3-54-24]


"I for myself will be comfortable only on eliminating him who has eliminated Khara
and Duushana as with a pauper acquiring riches. [3-54-25]


"While you remain in Janasthaana you have to accurately bring me the information
about Rama's activities and deportment. [3-54-26]


"Do not go heedlessly, you all night-walkers, for that Rama appears to be too
dangerous, and on your going there heedfully, you have to continually try for the elimination of
that Raghava. [3-54-27]


"I am aware of your might in battle fronts for a number of times, as such I have
commissioned you all in that Janasthaana." Thus Ravana spoke to those eight demons. [3-54-28]


Then on picking up those words amiable to all intents and purposes of Ravana, those
eight demons departed from Lanka on hailing Ravana, and they collectively journeyed in the
direction of Janasthaana with their imperceivable appearances. [3-54-29]


Ravana is then highly gladdened well and truly on gaining over Seetha, and even for
holding sway over that Maithili, and equally for the well-wrought and archly animosity with Rama,
whereby that demon Ravana is hypocritically amused. [3-54-30]

On seeing those two very dexterous scions of Kakutstha, and the best ones from Raghu dynasty, namely Rama and Lakshmana, 
grabbed and being carried off, Seetha screamed in a high-pitched voice.[3-4-1]


"He that truth-abiding, virtuous, and the flawless Rama of Dasharatha is carried off along with Lakshmana by the demon with 
a ferocious look... [3-4-2]


"Wild bears, tigers and panthers aspire to eat me away... oh, best demon, thieve me instead and release Kakutstha-s... Hail 
to thee..." [Said Seetha.] [3-4-3]


On hearing Vaidehi's that utterance those valorous ones Rama and Lakshmana speedily busied themselves in eliminating that 
evil-minded demon Viradha. [3-4-4]


Soumitri indeed severed the left arm of that ferocious one, while Rama rent the right arm of that demon with his might. [3-4-5]


When his arms are mutilated that demon similar to a dark-cloud is frustrated, fainted, and fell onto ground, like the mountain 
demolished by the Thunderbolt of Indra. [3-4-6]


They battered that demon with their fists, hands and feet, and even by heaving and hurling him again and again they entirely 
pounded on him on the ground. [3-4-7]


Though that demon is battered with many arrows, even sheared off with two swords, and even though he is entirely pounded 
on the ground he is not killed. [3-4-8]


On observing that the mountain-similar demon is ineradicable that easily, then Rama, the sublime one, and the bestower of 
shelter in fear, spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. [3-4-9]


"Oh! Manly-tiger Lakshmana, it is impossible to overpower this demon with weapons in a confrontation, hence, let's bury 
this demon... [3-4-10]


"Lakshmana, a very deep pit be dug for this furious and ferocious reprobate in this forest, as though for an elephant... 
[3-4-11]


On saying to Lakshmana that a trench shall be dug...' then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and 
stood by. [3-4-12]


On hearing that said by Raghava, demon Viradha sincerely spoke these humble words to Rama, the finest one from Kakutstha 
dynasty. [3-4-13]


"Dead I am, oh! Manly-tiger and a coequal of Indra in your strength... I have fallaciously not identified you earlier... 
oh, best one among men... [3-4-14]


"Oh, sire, now I have known you to be Rama, the son of Kausalya... and even propitious Seetha and greatly renowned one Lakshmana 
are now known to me... [3-4-15]


"By curse I had to enter this ghoulish demon's body, but I am a celestial gandharva, named Tumburu and Kubera cursed me... 
[3-4-16]


"When entreated by me, he that greatly renowned Kubera said to me, 'When Dasharatha's Rama kills you in a fight... then 
you will attain your nature of celestial body and you will go to heavens...' [3-4-17, 18a]


" King Kubera thus cursed angrily me for not presenting myself in his service when I was interested in a celestial dancer 
Rambha, and indeed he alone said this curse-clearance to me... [3-4-18b, 19a]


" And by your grace I am released from this utterly hideous cruse, and now I wish to go to my own heavenly abode, oh, firestorm 
of enemies, let safety betide you all... [3-4-19b, 20a]


"Oh, Sire, att one and half yojana-s of distance from here Sage Sharabhanga, a great saint of virtue, and an efficacious 
sage with sun-like resplendence dwells, you shall quickly approach him for he advises you opportunely... [3-4-20-21]


"Rama you go safely on burying me in a pit... this is the age-old custom for those demons that lost vitality... those that 
are inhumed in pit, to them there will be the worlds of manes..." [3-4-22, 23a]


"And on saying thus to Rama that Viradha who is hurt by arrows became heaven-worthy on leaving his body. [3-4-23b, 24a]


And Raghava on hearing those words of the demon ordered Lakshmana, "Lakshmana, a very deep pit be dug for this furious and 
ferocious reprobate in this forest, as though for an elephant..." On saying to Lakshmana that a trench shall be dug...' 
then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and stood by. [3-4-24b, 25, 26]


Then, on taking a digging tool Lakshmana dug a deep pit beside the great soul Viradha. [3-4-27]


On releasing his throat from the stamping of Rama, he that long eared, lurid voiced Viradha is ensconced in that pit while 
he is still blaring with his horrific voice. [3-4-28]


Those deftly victorious ones Rama and Lakshmana who compose themselves in a given fight, both have gladly raised that Viradha, 
a ghoulish one in fight, a terrifying demon who is still blaring, with all their might and hurled him into the pit. [3-4-29]


On observing the indestructibility of that demon with any weapon, however sharp it might be, those two best ones among men 
that are very expertly skilled have thought over well and undertook the elimination of that great demon in a pit. [3-4-30]


Viradha himself preferred his death at the hands of Rama and desired for a long to be killed by Rama and that forest walker 
himself appraised that, "Killing me with any weapon is impossible..." [3-4-31]


On listening to that which is said by Viradha, Rama resolved his mind to cast him into pit, and when that mighty demon is 
being flung into the pit the whole forest blared with that demon's cries. [3-4-32]


Rama and Lakshmana felt happy by way of their look in burying Viradha in the pit of the earth, and on burying him they two 
felt rejoiced for gone is the fear in that great forest, and within the pit they have also concealed him with boulders in 
order to make it a burial-chamber to the departed soul. [3-4-33]


Then they two who have dazzling golden bows have eliminated that demon and retrieved Seetha, and they gladly journeyed on 
in that great forest like the two entities abiding on the skies, namely the Sun and Moon. [3-4-34]


The episode of Viraadha assumes some importance in Hindu mythology. It may be observed 
that Viraadha drops down Seetha, lifts and carries Rama and Lakshmana far away from Seetha, where Rama and Lakshmana kill 
Viraadha. <em>aadhyaatma raamaayana</em> which occurs in the&nbsp; chapter 61 of
<em>brahmaanmda puraana</em> also narrates this episode of Viradha as a one to one fight, herein Rama 
affronts and kills him straight. But in Valmiki Ramayana, Viradha takes away Seetha first and then Rama and Lakshmana, too. 
A question arises as to why the demon should snatch Seetha away and later carry Rama and Lakshmana to a distant place from 
Seetha. It is part of the scheme that Rama kills no demon or sinner in the presence of Seetha, including Ravana, for she 
is that benevolent one to all the sinners and pardons them if surrendered in faith at her feet, as an incarnation of Goddess 
Lakshmi. Our concern here is with <em>skaanda purana</em> , a Shiva Puraana, in which Viradha's episode 
is explained detailedly. The <em>skaanda puraana</em> puts it as:


On seeing Seetha Viraaadha thought, " She is the Supreme goddess through whom heavens can be obtained by salvation and also 
release from the bondage [of demon's body ] On just seeing Her, relieved is this body cage, so with all my devotion, I steal 
Her ." etc. Hence <em>vi raadha</em> meant to be verily, devout, like Radha of Krishna. When chased 
and hurt by Rama and Lakshmana, the demon releases Seetha, but carries both the brothers away. For this distancing Rama 
and Lakshmana from Seetha, it is said that Rama does not kill any demon in the presence of Seetha, for she graciously condones 
the mischief of the demons, if they are true devotees.


Again in <em>skaanda puraana</em>, at the end of this Viraaadha episode, the <em>phala shruti</em> [Fruit 
of Listening] it is narrated as:


" Those that always listen or let listen this episode of virAdha, all their sins are absolved, undoubtedly .. skaanda pauraana

 On Sage Sharabhanga attaining heaven, groups of sages assembled and approached
  Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, who is glowing with resplendence. [3-6-1]


 The sages called Vaikahanasa-s, [who are born out of the nails of Prajaapati, the
  first ruler of mankind,] also Vaalakhilyaa-s, [those born from His hair,] and those from the
  water of His feet-wash, and those that thrive on drinking rays of sun and moon alone, and those
  that pound with stones and others who thrive on leaves alone, are those sages... [3-6-2]


 Some of them use their own teeth to grid the grain they eat, and some who perform
  ascesis in neck-deep water, and some who sleep with their head resting on their shoulders or on
  chests without using any kind of bed, and some who do not use any kind of beds either, and some
  who meditate without any repose sitting in an enclosure without any leg-space. [3-6-3]


 And some sages whose food is water alone, or air alone to some, like that some who
  meditate staying in sky and some who sleep on bare ground itself. [3-6-4]


 Thus some are dwellers on high-peaked places with their senses controlled, and
  some are wearers of wet cloths, always reciting name or hymn japa and like that some who meditate
  with five kinds of fire around them. [3-6-5]


 All have Vedic resplendence and firm yogic control, and they have arrived at the
  hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga for Rama. [3-6-6]


 Those virtuous sages coming together in groups neared Rama, the best beholder of
  virtue, and said to that supreme one in virtue. [3-6-7]


 "You are the supreme charioteer born in Ikshvaku dynasty hence you are the
  protector of earth under your control. As with Indra, the ruler of divinities you are a similar
  ruler for us. [3-6-8]


 Though born in Ikshvaku dynasty you are the Supreme Charioteer, hence you are the
  same Supreme Charioteer of this Earth and earthlings too, as with Indra who protects divinities,
  you are our protector.


 "You are well renowned in all the three worlds by your repute and valour, and in
  you abounding are the virtues like truthfulness and devotion to your father, and even
  righteousness too, is there. [3-6-9]


 "You are the great-souled one, knower of righteousness and a patron of virtue...
  such as you are, on approaching you we beg to state something for which we may please be
  excused... [3-6-10]


 "Oh! , very great a-dharma, wrongness, will occur to that king who takes the sixth
  part of the country's produce as cess, but does not safeguard his subjects like his own sons...
  [3-6-11]


 "A king shall treat all the subjects of kingdom as his own sons, and he shall
  protect them as though he is ready to save them at the cost of his own lives, and he who will
  always be endeavouring in that manner will attain permanent renown lasting for many for many
  years to come, and thereby he attains a prosperous place even in Brahma's abode... [3-6-12,
  3]


 "He who righteously protects his subjects will get one fourth of the merit of
  great duty-bound deeds performed by each individual sage, say yajna-s, ascesis, meditation etc.
  performances. [3-6-14]


 "O, Rama, though you are there as protector for the hermitages, suchlike this one,
  where the most reverent Brahmans are there numerously, they look as though forsaken, for they are
  being demolished by demons, devastatingly... [3-6-15]


 "Come and see many of the bodies of the sages, the contemplative souls, that are
  variously killed by ghastly demons in the forest... [3-6-16]


 "At Pampa riverside, and alongside of River Mandakini, and at the surroundings of
  Mt. Chitrakuta also, this hideous warfare is being done... [3-6-17]


 "Thus. we are not able to tolerate this injustice to the sages, being executed in
  this forest by the demons with fiendish deeds, in a ghastly manner... [3-6-18]


 "Therefore we present ourselves before you as you are our protector, for the
  purpose of your protecting us that are being killed by nightwalkers... please safe guard us...
  [3-6-19]


 "Other than you, oh, valorous Rama, no way-out is deducible on this earth, hence
  oh, prince, protect all of us from the demons... [3-6-20]


 On hearing all that is said by the sages of great penance, he that virtue souled
  Rama said this unto all of the sages. [3-6-21]


 "Unapt is this way of speaking to me...command me, for I am at your behest... just
  for my personal purpose I had to enter the forests.... [3-6-22]


 "I entered this forest as ordered by my father and even to obliterate the
  unconscionable state of yours owing to the misdeeds of demons. [3-6-23]


 "Perchance I have come for the achievement of your purpose, such as I am, dwelling
  in this forest will immensely be fruitful to me... [3-6-24]


 "I wish to eliminate demons, the enemies of sages, in war... let the sages behold
  my valour, and my brother's valour in doing so..." Thus Rama promised the sages. [3-6-25]


 Thus giving his aegis to the sages, that valiant Rama who is firmly virtue-souled,
  journeyed towards Sage Suteekshna with Lakshmana and the sages, and along with the one given by
  Honourable Janaka, namely Seetha. [3-6-26]

When Maareecha spoke those acceptable and equitable words, Ravana rejected them like
a person with a death wish rejects medicament. [3-40-1]


Ushered by the Terminator the king of demons Ravana, uncouthly spoke these
unbefitting words to Maareecha who had been speaking conducive and beneficial words of advise.
[3-40-2]


"All these meaningless words that are being said to me are decidedly worthless, in
effect, like the seeds seeded in wastelands. [3-40-3]


"But it is impossible to scare me away from a war with that iniquitous and imprudent
Rama, that too, from a human being, with these words of yours. [3-40-4]


"He who bolted off to forest in a single-foot on hearing the artless words of a
woman, forfeiting his kingdom, friends and relatives, and even his mother, likewise his father too,
you cannot scare me away from such a Rama. [3-40-5]


"But his wife Seetha who is dearer to him more than his lives is certainly seizable
by me in association with you, as that Rama had purposelessly killed Khara in a war. [3-40-6]


"In this way my thinking is decided and it is lingering on in my heart, and it is
impossible to roll back my mind or heart even for Indra coming along with gods and demons.
[3-40-7]


"If you are asked about the credits or discredits, or either of the danger or
ideation of the deed for determining its modus operandi, it will be apt of you to talk like this,
but I did not seek any viewpoints of yours. [3-40-8]


"Even if someone is asked, and if he desires his own welfare, then he has to submit
his opinion to the king suppliantly upraising his palm-fold, may he be an intellectual, or an
astute adviser. [3-40-9]


"The king being lord of the land is to be addressed preceded with gentility, with
auspicious and beneficial words that do not contradict the interests of that lord, more so, they
shall be inclusive of etiquette. [3-40-10]


"Or else, oh, Maareecha, even if a beneficial word is said, but if it is said with
reprehension it will not gladden that king who insists upon honour, for that said word is
dishonourable, let alone reprehension. [3-40-11]


"The kings with infinite vigour embody five constituents forces of Fire, Moon, Rain,
Terminator, and that of Indra, the Administrator of Natural Forces. [3-40-12]


"Oh, nightwalker, thus the kings being great-souls personify the sultriness of Fire,
sternness of Indra, softness of Moon, suppleness of Rain, and harshness of Terminator, and
therefore in all situations they are respectable and reverential. [3-40-13, 14a]


"But you are ill-advisedly babbling with me in this way, incognizant of rectitude
and holding on to your obsession, and wishing ill of me, as I am on your doorstep. [3-40-14b,
15a]


"Oh, demon, I did not ask the rights and wrongs concerning me, nor that which is
expedient for me, but oh, demon of untold bravery, I have said this much to you. [3-40-15]


" 'It will be apt of you to proffer a helping hand in this deed.' This much I said
to you. And such as you are you may now listen to that task which you have to undertake during the
course of your assistance as I detail it to you. [3-40-16]


"On becoming an amazing silver-potted golden deer you move in front of Seetha in the
hermitage of Rama, and on verily alluring Vaidehi you can go away as you like. [3-40-17, 18 ]


"On seeing you as a wholly illusory golden deer curiosity arises in Vaidehi, and
indeed she tells Rama, 'bring that one quickly.' [3-40-19]


"Further, on Rama's coming out of his hermitage you go distantly and blurt out in
this way, 'ha Seetha' and even as, 'ha, Lakshmana,' mimicking Rama's voice. [3-40-20]


"On hearing that, and further hastened by Seetha, even Soumitri apprehensively
follows the path of Rama in all his fondness for Rama. [3-40-21]


"When Rama is diverted from hermitage, Lakshmana as well, I will carry off Vaidehi
effortlessly like the Thousand-eyed Indra who once carried off Sachi Devi. [3-40-22]


"Oh, demon, on carrying out this stint in this manner you may go as you like, and to
you oh, Maareecha with solemn vows, I will grant half of my kingdom. [3-40-23]


"Hence, oh, gentle one, get going on a trouble-free path for the easy achievement of
the task, and I for myself will follow you to Dandaka forest along with the chariot. [3-40-24]


"My goal will be achieved just by misleading Raghava, and by gaining Seetha without
a conflict, then I will proceed to Lanka along with you. [3-40-25]


"If you are not going to do so, oh, Maareecha, for sure I will kill you now itself.
I will get my work done through you even under duress, and indeed, any subject setting against his
king will never succeed safely. [3-40-26]


"Your life may be indefinite on reaching Rama, but your death is surely definite now
as you are conflicting with me. Hence, keeping all this in view you come to a conclusion that would
be conducive to your interests, and whatever desirable to you let it be done in that way. " Thus
Ravana spoke to Maareecha. [3-40-27]

Even though Rama is elder to Lakshmana he gleaned the ultimate tenor of Lakshmana's
words when Lakshmana just said them expediently because Raghava is a best gleaner of the gist of
advises. [3-67-1]


Such as he is that dextrous Rama on controlling his highly heightening fury,
propping against his bedazzling bow spoke this to Lakshmana. [3-67-2]


"What is to be done by us, oh, dear boy... or, whereto we might go, or, by which
device Seetha is discernable... Lakshmana, now you think of it, clearly... [3-67-3]


To such a Rama who is tormented by anguish, Lakshmana said, "it will be apt of you
to search this Janasthaana alone which is rife with many demons, and replete with manifold trees
and climber-plants... [3-67-4]


"Here there are unclimbable mountains, glens and glyphs as well. There are divers
and pernicious caverns tumultuous with diverse packs of predators, and here are the mansions of
kinnaraa-s and palaces of gandharva-s, as well... [3-67-5b, 6]


"It will be apt of you to steadfastly search in them along with me, and oh, best one
among men, your sort of literati and clever-souls will be unfluctuating in calamities like the
mountains unfluctuating in windstorms..." Lakshmana said so Rama. [3-67-6, 7, 8a]


When Lakshmana said in this way to that ireful Rama, he roved entire forest along
with Lakshmana readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on his bow. [3-67-8b, 9a]


Then Rama beheld Jataayu who is akin to a mountaintop in his gleam, and a best
beatific brave bird among all the birds, but bloodstained and buckling on earth. [3-67-9b, 10a]


On beholding him who is like a mountaintop in his gleam, Rama said to Lakshmana,
"This one has gluttonised Seetha, the princess from Vaidehi, there is no doubt about it...
[3-67-10b, 11a]


"It is apparent that this demon skulks in the forest in the semblance of an eagle,
and having gluttonised that wide-eyed Seetha he is now reposing comfortably. I will eliminate him
with deadly arrows, whose arrowheads blaze away and which shoot off straightly..." Thus Rama
declared. [3-67-11b, 12]


On saying thus and on readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on his
bow, that ireful Rama rushed towards the eagle, as though to a-tremble the whole of the earth that
which is within the perimeter of oceans. [3-67-13]


But that bird spewing up frothy blood pathetically appealed to such an ireful son of
Dasharatha, namely Rama, in a pathetic tone. [3-67-14]


"Oh, boy Rama, blest is your eternality, for whom you are searching as with the
search of a rejuvenescent herb in the vast of forest, Ravana stole that lady and my lives, too...
[3-67-15]


"I have seen that lady while being stolen by brute-forced Ravana when you and even
Lakshmana absented from her... [3-67-16]


"I outreached to rescue Seetha... and in a combat Ravana is rendered as one with
utterly battered chariot... and I felled him and that chariot there... onto earth's surface...
[3-67-17]


"This one is his fragmented bow and this is his fragmented armour... oh, Rama, this
is his combat-chariot... which, in combat shattered by me... [3-67-18]


"This is his charioteer drop dead onto earth by my wings... when I am overtired
Ravana gashed my wings and flew skyward taking Seetha of Videha kingdom with him, and it will be
inapt of you to kill me who am already killed by the demon..." Thus Jataayu appealed to Rama.
[3-67-19, 20]


Rama jettisoned his forceful bow when he heard the much desired news about Seetha
while hugging that kingly eagle Jataayu. [3-67-21]


Even though Rama is comparatively a bold person he involuntarily fell down to
ground, as the onefold scorch of anguish for Seetha is doubled by this predicament of Jataayu, and
he wept over Jataayu. [3-67-22]


Jataayu is supine on a single-strait passable for a single-person and he is
suspiring for several times, and on seeing such Jataayu Rama became anguished and spoke this to
Soumitri. [3-67-23]


"Mislaid is my kingdom and I am mislocated into forests, Seetha is misplaced and now
this mischance of death on this bird... this kind of misfortune of mine incinerates even Agni, the
Divine-Incinerator... [3-67-24]


"Even if it were to be a plethoric and limitless ocean, and now if I were to enter
it, or take a swim to the other shore of blissfulness, even that Lord of Rivers runs completely
dry, owing to my misfortune, it is definite... [3-67-25]


"There will not be any greater unfortunate being in this world than me, even if all
the sessile and mobile beings are put together, by whom such a complicated catastrophic enmeshment
as this is derived... [3-67-26]


"This decrepit kingly eagle is the friend of my father who is terminally gashed and
recumbent on the floor owing only to the backlash of my fortune..." So lamented Rama for the
wounded eagle Jataayu. [3-67-27]


Thus, lamenting in that way for many times Raghava patted the body of Jataayu along
with Lakshmana instancing his parental regard. [3-67-28]


On hugging that kingly eagle whose wings are hacked off and who is bloodstained, and
on uttering this much, "she who is identical with my lives,... where is that Maithili..." Rama
collapsed to earth. [3-67-29]

On seeing her who fell before him in a misshapen and blood-soaked condition, demon Khara is all stewed 
up and asked her. [3-19-1]


"Rise up, first tell me clearly putting away your flurry and fluster, who disfigured your form in this 
way. [3-19-2]


"Who for sport is poking his fingertip at a venomously fanged black-cobra that has chanced in his close 
proximity but slouching down inoffensively. [3-19-3]


"Who on harrowing you is now heedless about his gulping a deadly poison, or about his foolish bracing 
the noose of Time around his own neck. [3-19-4]


"You are gifted with boldness and braveness, a whimsical rover, a guise changer by your wish, a coequal 
of Terminator, but to whom you have gone and by whom you are led into this kind of plight. [3-19-5]


"Who is that kind of highly intrepid warper, either from gods, or from celestials or from high-souled 
sages who indeed rendered you shapeless. [3-19-6]


"Indeed, I do not find anyone who causes displeasure to me in this world, even among divinities including 
the thousand eyed Indra, the controller of demon Paaka. [3-19-7]


"Now, I will take away the lives of that miscreant with my arrows that are terminators of lives, as 
a swan would drink milk to dregs even if it is mingled in water, duly separating milk from water. [3-19-8]


"Whose frothy blood is it that the earth wishes to quaff when I cut off his crucial organs by my arrows 
and drop him dead in a combat. [3-19-9]


"Whose body is it from which birds pressing round gladly wish to wring flesh to pieces for eating when 
I slay him in war. [3-19-10]


"Now, when I haul him easily on the ground in a battle that villain will be unredeemable either by gods, 
celestials, evil spirits, or by demons. [3-19-11]


"It will be apt of you to gather your sensitivity slowly and tell me as to which miscreant attacked 
and worsted you in the forest." Thus Khara spoke to Shuurpanakha. [3-19-12]


On hearing this kind of words of her brother, especially who is rancorous, then Shuurpanakha spoke these 
words, tearfully. [3-19-13]


"Those two are in adulthood, good-looking, gentle yet greatly mighty, eyes broad like lotuses, dressed 
in jute-cloths and deerskin, subsistent on fruits and tubers, composed, sagacious and celibate, and 
they are the sons of Dasharatha, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [3-19-14,15]


<em>taruNau ruupa sampannau</em> Though they scarred her on her nose and ears she did not loose her 
heart for them. This <em>taruNau ruupa sampannau</em> is in accordance with Rama's aspect which will 
be <em>sadaiva priya darshanaH</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'the same pleasant persona at any time' as in Bala Kanda at 1-1-16, 
as said by Sage Narada to Valmiki. This is the same situation with Hanuma when Seetha asks him to indicate 
some aspects of Rama so as to believe Hanuma. There Hanuma starts with <em>raamaH kamala patra akshaH 
sarva sattva manoharaH - sundara 35-8.</em> 'Rama is lotus-petal eyed one' Further people in sleep, 
intoxicated or infuriated conditions, will speak their heart <em>supramatta kupitaanaam bhaava j~naanam 
dR^iSTaH</em> So Shuurpanakha who is also in a sleep like daze, she came out with her soulful feelings 
about Rama.


This narration has threefold meaning. 1] Through the eyes of a lustful female; 2] To belittle Rama and 
Lakshmana's prowess only to extol Kara's pride; 3] To deride Khara's valour so that he gets incited 
to fight Rama and Lakshmana.


<em>taruNau</em> 'came of age.' <em>kanyaam varayate ruupam</em> Women's first criterion towards a man 
is age. But this wording is in <em>dwivacana</em> 'in duel number' so it belongs to both Rama and Lakshmana. 
Then the question comes 'is she leaning towards both of them?' Yes. She makes eyes at both. First she 
approached Rama, but he advised her to approach Lakshmana. Lakshmana in turn advises her to approach 
Rama, thus she got interest in both. This is as per <em>anyonya sadR^ishau viirau</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'those darers 
are similar to one another.' Rama and Lakshmana may be different among themselves, but to the onlookers 
they appear as one reality. Further, she has hate-thinking for both of them also. She says that 'this 
situation occurred due to both of them' as at 3-19-18. How can she fall after both at a time? She can, 
with 'either-or-single-or-both' syndrome because she is a demoness, and unseen are such brothers with 
their glorious aspects, so far by her.


<em>ruupa sampannau</em> 'their aspects are ravishing' The syndrome is that <em>angaat angaat sambhavasi</em> 
'offshoots derive parent's aspects.' So Manmatha, the Love-God derived all his aspects from Vishnu. 
Then it is imaginable how much more that Vishnu might be in his lovely aspect. So Rama is with <em>niratishaya 
ruupa samR^iddhi</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'sublime features, endowed with' that which can be borrowed even by Manmatha.


<em>sukumaarau</em> 'delicate' like flowers. Rama is said to equal a delicate flower. <em>asiita puSpa 
samkaasham</em> Rama's body itself is a flower that which can be cherished by all. Or <em>su</em> 
= excellent;
<em>ku</em> =of earth; <em>maarau</em> = Manmatha-s' 'two Manmatha-s on earth' Manmatha, is only one 
god of love and without any form or body parts, but these two are having excellent forms and are evident 
on earth before eyes as per the attribute of <em>kandarpa iva muurtimaan</em> 'he has a form like that 
of Love-god'


Then her bother Khara may ask 'then why we demons shall hanker after some flimsy, fragile, feeble creatures?' 
For that she says <em>mahaa balau</em> 'greatly vigorous.' They have un-depleting vigour of manhood, 
which is what required by an aged demoness.


<em>puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> 'white-lotus, broad, eyed' 'Their eyes are not like ours while our 
eyes are <em>samrakta nayanaa ghoraa</em> 'bloodshot eyes of terrible look'


Or, unlike <em>tamo guNa udreka</em> 'ever persisting with stolid constituent of nature' and unlike
<em>rajo guNodreka</em> 'ever energetic with sprightly constituent of nature' -- their eyes are <em>
sattva guNa sampanna</em> 'serene with the pure constituent of nature' Though Rama says that he <em>
aatmaanaam maanuSyam manye</em> 'in my soul I consider I am human' but as per <em>shruti</em> / scripture,
<em>yathaakapyaasam puNDariikam evam akshiNii</em> 'though his outward aspect is hiding his real Being, 
his eyes are telling the truth of His supernal nature', hence Rama is other-worldly.


Or his white broad eyes are comparable with <em>kshiira samudra</em> Milky-ocean, his abode, with its 
unfathomable depths, so is his heart.


Or <em>mahaa balau puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> 'Great mighty and white broad eyed ones' who by their 
great might annihilate vice and if the evildoer submits himself, their white eyes alone give salvation 
with a broad-mind. <em>sukumaarau puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> 'Manmatha-like, white, broad eyed' 



If it is said that these two are Love-gods on earth, then it may be asked 'where are the flowery arrows of that 
Love-god to these two?' But the arrows of these earthly Love-gods are their eyes and glances. The 
lotus is but one among the five arrows of Manmatha. Even Seetha under her direly distressed situation 
in Lanka says that 'gods, celestials, great-souls et al are sanctified with the look of this lotus-petal 
eyed one' <em>dhanyaa devaaH sa gandhavaaH siddhaaH ca paramarSyaH | mama pashyanti ye naadhama raamam 
raajiiva locanam || sundara 26-41.</em> This verse takes its place in <em>gayatri ramayaNa</em> as its 
14th verse out of total 27 verses.


Further they are excelling only by their nature but not by their dressings and outfits for they are 
just clad in <em>ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau</em> 'jute-cloths, deerskin wearers of' Mahaakavi Kalidasa 
says in his <em>abhij~naana shaakuntalam:</em> says <em>iyam [shakuntala] adhika manoj~naa valkalena api 
tanvii</em> that, 'this Shakuntala is pleasant though clad in jute-cloths' <em>kimavahi madhuraaNaam 
maNDananam na akR^itiinaam</em> 'nothing can beautify beautiful people' etc. Though not adorned by any 
extra special ornamentation they by their nature are attractive, as discerned by sages at 3-1-13 of 
Aranya Kanda <em>ruupa samhanam lakshmiim saukumaarya suveSatam</em> as well by this Shuurpanakha or 
even by Ravana in part II of Yuddha Kanda, in 99th chapter 12th verse, who also extols these lotus eyes 
and the aspect of Rama on his first sight at Rama as <em>padma patra vishaala aksham diirgha baahum 
arindamam</em>


Should Khara ask in fear 'who is that great-mighty one who mutilated a sister of a great demon like 
me? Thereby my fear is growing about my own existence.' Then Shuurpanakha's reply is like this, in 
order to remove Khara's fear of Rama:


<em>taruNau</em>&nbsp; 'youngsters, boys' for his own father Dasharatha tells Vishvamitra that these are
<em>uuna Sodasha varshau; na yuddha yogyatam asya apashyaami</em> in Bala Kanda. Shuurpanakha that way 
tells Khara 'brother Khara... these two Rama and Lakshmana are boyish you need not care them, ' Further
<em>yauvane viSayaisiNaam</em> 'boys in young age bother more for enjoymentï -- they are bothered to 
enjoy life and are not yet fit for a war, so you can war with them'


<em>ruupa sampannau</em> 'just by getups they are brilliant, but lack in courage to confront you'
<em>kanyaa kaamayet ruupam</em> 'girls cherish charming ones' 'They fall after girls only with their 
charming aspects that are unworthy to withstand war, so you can war with them'


<em>sukumaarau</em> 'delicate or fragile, or flimsy,' because they are sons of some king, grown up in 
palace chambers, unlike us who grow in ravines; and they eat nonsensically delectable food, unlike us 
who happily eat raw-flesh. So, wherefrom they can tolerate your bloodshot glances, let alone your arrows...'


<em>mahaa.abalu = mahaa + a + balau</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'very, without, strength; very weak fellows';


furthermore <em>mahaa abalau; 
mahatii rakshaNiiyaa abalaa yayostu</em> 'a lady, namely Seetha, is to be protected by them. She has 
become a string fastened around their necks. Then how do they, the sentinels of a woman, can fight you...'


<em>puNDariika vishalaa akshau</em> 'paled, broadened, eyed' 'Their eyes paled and wide-open awaiting 
the results of their scarring my nose and ears, and their eyes popped up in daze, then what can they 
do to you...'


Then Khara may ask, "it is good you have said that they are hapless etc., but they may now muster up 
some army and fight me back then what?' 


For this she says, <em>ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau</em> 'wearers 
of jute-cloths and deerskin' And furthering her argument she says, 'how can they afford an army for 
they themselves have nothing special to wear. That too one of those items, namely the jute-cloth, is 
begged from a tree that is sessile, and the other, the deerskin, is begged from a deer, that is mobile.&nbsp; They themselves 
are shuttling in between mobile and sessile how can they confront you.' 


Further, this god, say this 
Rama, has no other special work or duty, except shuttling between mobile or sessile beings or matter, 
begging their produce, and beg them to recognise him.


Her words also extol the capabilities of Rama and Lakshmana in warring and said to have addressed Khara 
this way in order to enhance his self-pride.


<em>tarunau; yauvane vijigiisuNaam</em> 'youthful ones 
are interested in triumphs' 'Because they are the seekers of triumphs, they will definitely triumph 
over you, you better do not go there and get defeated'


<em>ruupa sampannau; ruupyate anena; asaadhaaraNa niratishaya ruupa visheSatvaat</em> 'with an unimaginable 
stance' They are known for their stance from their childhood in eliminating Tataka, Subaahu etc.,
<em>gatvaa saumitri sahito naa vijitya ivartate</em> 'on going with Lakshmana, he [Rama] does not return 
without conquering' <em>yashasaH ca eka bhaajanam : Tara in Kishkindha, 14-20.</em> 'for glory [Rama 
is] the only resort.' 'So many praises are said about them and hence they fight you out, better do not go'


If Khara asks, 'how can they fight me, such a mighty one?' 


For this she says, <em>sukumaarau</em> 'they 
are dextrous' 'with their dexterity they easily eliminate you'


<em>mahaa balau</em> 'greatly mighty' 'Rama is mightily by his shoulder-strength' and also by the use 
of <em>mahat shabda</em> his might is by his tenacity of mind and ideation to eliminate foes. Or <em>
mahaa balau</em> 'greatly sturdy.' Though he wars for a long his vigour does not deplete for he uses 
two <em>vidya-s: bala, atibala</em> 'by the twin principles taught by Vishvamitra his strength does 
not deplete.


<em>puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> 'white-lotus, broad, eyed' His broad white-lotus like eyes does 
neither contract in anger nor expand in exclamation, as usually happen to anyone who sees an object 
of interest with unnecessary widening of eyes <em>priiti visphaarita iikshaNam</em>


Next if it be asked 'are they ready for a fight' for which she says 'they are already clad in <em>ciira 
kR^ishNa ajina dharau</em> 'jute-cloth, deerskin, clad in' They have tightened their girdle-cloths and 
are armoured in shield like deerskin. Further they also have arrows and knives with which I am scarred 
so better not to go there and get your throat slit like my nose and ears, for you are a shameless, incapable 
demon still sitting here as I go on narrating the incident like a story'



"Having all the aspects 
of kings they equal the kings of gandharva celestials, and I am ill-disposed to differentiate whether 
they two are gods or demons. [3-19-16]



" I have seen a curvaceous 
lady between those two, a ripely beauty, rich in comeliness, adorned with lots of ornaments. [3-19-17]



"Owing to that woman I am 
led into this sort of situation, together by those two, as with an insecure female. [3-19-18]



"Staying in the van of war 
I wish to drink the frothy blood of that guileful Seetha along with that of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, 
when they are killed in war. [3-19-19]



"I shall drink her blood 
and also that of those two in war, this being my prime longing let it be fulfilled by you." Thus wailed 
Shuurpanakha before her brother Khara. [3-19-20]



While she is saying like 
that Khara vengefully summoned fourteen great mighty demons that are similar to the Terminator. [3-19-21]



"Wielding weapons and wearing 
jute-cloths and deerskin two humans have got into ghastly forest of Dandaka along with a woman of age." 
Thus Khara is ordering the fourteen demons. [3-19-22]



"You shall return to me only on killing those two and also that 
treacherous woman, and their blood this sister of mine will drink. [3-19-23]



"Oh, demons, on going there swiftly stamp them out by you own 
vigour, thus let the fanciful hearty desire of my sister be achieved. [3-19-24]



"On seeing your finishing those two brothers flatly in a war she 
this sister of mine will be gladdened, and then she drinks their blood in war, amusingly. [3-19-25]



In this way when Khara ordered those fourteen demons, they have 
gone to Panchavati along with Shuurpanakha like black-clouds glided by gales. [3-19-26]



But then, though the nightwalker wielding sharp arrows have become 
ineffectual to trounce Rama like the wild elephants which will become ineffectual to overcome the blazingly 
uprising wildfire. [3-19-27]

Maheshvara Tiirtha notes 
that God Shiva cursed Khara and pardoned saying that he will be released from curse by Rama of Dasharatha.
<em>tasmaadyaH 
kruura ruupeNa dehena harataa amR^itam | viShNur daasharathir bhuutvaa mokShayiShyati suvrata |</em> 
In the <em>sheSa dharma</em> of Maha Bharata in the discourse between Bhiishma and Yudhistira it is 
said that sage Yajnavalkya has three sons. They are Chandrakanta, Mahaamedha and Vijaya. These three 
Brahmans became Khara, Duushana, and Trishira by the curse of Shiva. The first one Chandrakanta is Khara. 
And the disciples of the three Brahman scholars are fourteen and they also became Brahma-demons, who 
are now being sent. On listening Shuurpanakha Khara came to know that Vishnu arrived in the form of 
Rama and thus Khara wanted to get release from the curse by Rama, and hence firstly he sends the fourteen 
demon-disciples, and later he and his brother also follow the suit.

There are fourteen thousand demons against one Rama, and the Divine beings watch this from heavens as 
a sport, without according any miraculous powers to Rama, suggesting that a human has to face any number 
of problems, here fourteen thousand demons, for himself and no divine grace suddenly comes to his help.


Rama gives the demons enough time and warning, but as the atrocity is escalating, he uses one gandharva 
missile and many other arrows, which will devastate the entire army of Dushana's brute force.


Khara on arriving at the hermitage along with forerunning soldiers saw the enemy-eliminator and wrathful 
Rama holding fast to his bow. [3-25-1]


On seeing Rama that bawling Khara raised his string-taut bow that makes an ass-like braying twang, drove 
his charioteer crazy saying, "drive to the fore of that Rama..." [3-25-2]


On the orders of Khara the charioteer drove the horses to there where the mighty armed Rama is standing 
single-handedly while swaying his bow. [3-25-3]


On seeing Khara descending on Rama then all those nightwalkers who are the deputies of Khara encircled 
Khara venting out loud battle cries. [3-25-4]


Khara staying on his chariot in the thick of those demons appeared to be like coppery-red planet Mars 
up-shot in the thick of stars. [3-25-5]


In his proneness to war then Khara assaulted that uniquely forceful Rama with a thousand arrows and 
blared a roaring battle cry. [3-25-6]


All of those infuriated nightwalkers then incessantly rained diverse weapons on that invincibleRama 
who is handling a horrific bow. [3-25-7]


Those demons that are already caught up with rancour bombarded Rama with bludgeons, lances, tridents, 
darts and hatchets. [3-25-8]


Those massive bodied and exceptionally mighty demons came jostling like immense clouds in their eagerness 
to kill Rama in that war, while some mounted on chariots and horsebacks, and some more riding mountain-ridges 
like elephants rushed in on Rama. [3-25-9,10a]


And those bands of demons have outpoured arrows on Rama, as with enormous black-clouds disemboguing 
torrents on a lofty mountain. [3-25-10b, 11a]


When hemmed in with those grisly-looking demons Rama appeared like Rudra surrounded by his divine retinue 
called <font color="#B3003A">prathama gaNa</font>-s, on certain days, whereupon he starts his all-destructive 
cosmic-dance. [3-25-11b, 12a]


That Raghava has pre-empted those arrows discharged by the demons with his excruciatingly pointed arrows 
as an ocean would do with the river's onrush. [3-25-12b, 13a]


Even if his body is gashed with those gruesome assault weapons Rama is not enfeebled, as with the enormous 
Mt. Meru that can withstand even if battered by very many highly blazing thunderbolts of Indra. [3-25-13, 
14a]


Bruised and bedaubed with blood on all his limbs that Rama of Raghu's dynasty took shape of the sun 
enshrouded by cloudscapes at eventide. [3-25-14b, 15a]


On seeing lone Rama beset by many demons, then the gods, celestials, saints and sublime-sages are dispirited. 
[3-25-15b, 16a]


But Rama on becoming highly infuriated curved his bow to a full circularity on stretching the bowstring 
up to his ear, and then jetted out trenchant arrows in hundreds. Why hundreds? He surged them in thousands. 
[3-25-16b, 17a]


In that war Rama sportily discharged eagle-feathered arrows adorned in gold which are unstoppable and 
intolerable, and which in simile are the leads of Time-god. [3-25-17b, 18a]


Those arrows that are playfully discharged on the army of enemy have grabbed the lives of demons like 
the tethers flung by the Time-god. [3-25-18b, 19a]


On impaling the bodies demons, the arrows swamped in blood have gone into welkin, where they are aglow 
with flares equalling inflamed flames. [3-25-19b, 20a]


Innumerable and highly frightening arrows fusilladed from the nimbus of the bow of Rama that resulted 
as the filchers of the lives of demons. [3-25-20b, 21a]


In that war, shooting now with hundreds, and now with thousands of such arrows, Rama shredded those 
many bows, pinnacles of war-flags, armours and the like. And even shred are the heads of demons, along 
with their ornamented arms and thighs similar to the trunks of elephants. [3-25-21b, 22]


With the arrows flung from the bow-bowstring-nimbus of Rama, he indeed shredded and scraped the horses 
hitched with golden harnesses, and the chariots to which they are yoked, and even their charioteers. 
Likewise, he even ripped off the elephants along with their riders, and the horses along with their 
cavaliers. And on eliminating infantrymen in that war Rama led them to the abode of Yama, the Time-god. 
[3-25-23, 24] [3-25-23]


While ripped to pieces with tubular arrows, with arrows made of iron, and with sharp-edged and crescent-tipped 
arrows those demons have let out disgusting cries of anguish. [3-25-25]


When those arrows that gore the critical parts are thus harrowing, that army is discomposed like a forest 
burnt to a cinder by wild-fire. [3-25-26]


Some of the grotesquely sinewy and braving nightwalkers are highly enraged and dashed their darts, tridents, 
and hatchets towards Rama. [3-25-27]


On fending off those weapons with his arrows that mighty armed and valorous Rama filched away their 
lives by shearing off their necks in that war. [3-25-28]


Those demons crashed down to earth with their heads severed and shields and bows wrecked, like the trees 
strewn around on earth owing to the gust raised by Garuda, the Divine Eagle, when he takes a sudden 
flight in heavens. [3-25-29]


Those nightwalkers that are battered by those arrows and remaining there, they desperately rushed towards 
Khara alone seeking shelter. [3-25-30]


Comforting all of them and taking his bow, very highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards that infuriated 
Rama like the furious Eliminator Yama.


That highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards Rama as highly infuriated Yama rushes towards Rudra, 
where Rudra being the ultimate eliminator himself, angry rush of Yama towards Rudra is therefore futile. 
[3-25-31]


Coming under the shelter of Duushana all of those demons are but emboldened and returned, and they once 
again rushed towards Rama with saala trees, palm trees and boulders as their weapons. [3-25-32]


Handling tridents, maces, and leashes those great-mighty demons have created torrents of arrows, missiles, 
trees and boulders, and inundated Rama in that war. [3-25-33, 34a]


Again there chanced a highly gruesome war between Rama and those demons that is tumultuous, stunning, 
and a hair-raising. [3-25-34b, 35a]


Those demons have resurfaced from all around pressurising Raghava in high dudgeon. On seeing the reappearance 
of demons from everywhere, with whom all the directions and inter-directions are fully filled, and who 
are storming torrents of arrows, then that exceptionally forceful Rama made a thunderous sound and launched 
an extremely blazing missile among the gather of demons, called gandharva missile. [3-25-35b, 36, 37]


Then from the nimbus of his bow, arrows in thousand have scurried out, and with them thus arrived all 
the ten sides are cramped up. [3-25-38]


Either the drawing of those supreme arrows from the quiver, or the traction of bowstring on placing 
them, or unloosing them from the bow is unperceived by those demons that are harrowing under those arrows. 
[3-25-39]


Darkness caused by the thick of the arrows overspread the sky including its sun, while Rama happened 
to persevere spewing forth his arrows. [3-25-40]


Far and wide the earth is scattered with herds that are falling instantaneously, hosts that have fallen 
instantly, and huddles that are already felled with an instantaneity. [3-25-41]


Thousands of demons are noticeable hither and yon, killed, fallen and enfeebled, and slashed, gashed 
and ripped. [3-25-42]


Some severed heads still have their headgears and some bare, some arms are with armlets and some bare, 
while some with their arms cut off, some with their thighs cut off, some with their divers patterns 
of ornaments on their bodies have fallen on ground. Numerous horses and elephants are felled. Chariots, 
royal-fans, royal-parasols, war-flags of very many kinds are ravaged in many ways. Hit down by Rama's 
arrows spears and tridents are variously splintered, swords broken to pieces, darts and hatchets shattered 
and strewn around. Also the boulders are pulverised, various amazing arrows have gone to rack and ruin 
in many ways. Spread with such wreckage the earth has become horrifying for a glance. [3-25-43, 44, 
45, 46]


On seeing the killed demons all the surviving demons have become enervated and they are rendered incapable 
to make a move towards Rama, the conqueror of enemy's capitals. [3-25-47]

On seeing the fourteen thousands demons of heinous crimes, and even on seeing Trishira, Duushana, and 
even Khara, who are all exterminated by lone Rama, then Shuurpanakha emitted a thunderous blare like 
a thundercloud. [3-32-1, 2]


Highly agitated to witness the deed done by Rama, which deed is highly impossible for others, she hurried 
Lanka ruled by Ravana. [3-32-3]


She saw Ravana who is fulgent with his own radiance, seated with ministers at his nearby in the midst 
of the divine aircraft Pushpaka, as with Indra who will be sitting amidst wind-gods. [3-32-4]


Seated similar to the Sun in firmament on a supreme golden throne, which resembles a golden Altar of 
Fire, and he himself resembling the blazing Ritual-fire spurting out of it when that Golden-Fire-Altar 
is drenched with plentiful ghee, she saw such a Ravana. [3-32-5]


An invincible one either for gods or gandharva-s, or to sages with exalted souls, or even to any other 
entity worth its name, whose appearance itself is catastrophic, and who is sitting identical to the 
Terminator, as though that Terminator himself is sitting with a wide gaped mouth, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha 
saw. [3-32-6]


One who is severally bruised in several combats of gods and demons with the thunderbolts from the Vajra 
weapon of Indra, and one who is severally blotched on his chest when the prongs of the tusks of Airavata, 
the lordly elephant of Indra, gored his chest, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-7]


One who has twenty arms, ten faces and a broad chest, and a possessor of all regalia of Indra like white 
parasol, white fanning instruments, colours and the like insigne, and at that brave one who is attributed 
with all of the kingly attributes, Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-8]


Blent with the gleam of Lapis gems studded in his ornaments his glisten is alike that gem, while 
his ear-knobs are made out of refined gold, and his arms strongish, teeth whitish, mouth widish and 
he is mountainous, and Shuurpanakha saw such a Ravana. [3-32-9]


His body bears hundreds of welts caused when assaulted with Vishnu-disc for hundreds of times in wars 
with gods, and when assaulted for hundreds of times with the other assaults-missiles in other gruesome 
wars as well, and Shuurpanakha saw at such a Ravana. [3-32-10]


Likewise, whose limbs are thrashed with thrashing missilery of all gods, whereby his body and soul have 
become harsh, thus he can perpetrate anything swiftly at his will, and he who can capably roil an un-perturbable 
ocean at his wish, at such Ravana Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-11]


At him who is a volleyer of mountain peaks, a represser of gods, an extirpator of ethical values, and 
a molester of others wives, Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-12]


He who is a marksman of every divine missile, and an ever interdictor of Vedic-rituals, and who on going 
to the city named Bhogavati, the capital of Naga-s, and on defeating Vaasuki, the King of Serpents, 
has abducted the dear wife of Taksha on molesting her, and Shuurpanakha saw such a molester of others 
wives. [3-32-13, 14a]


On going to Mt. Kailash he who has defeated the god who uses humans as his vehicle, namely Kubera, and 
snatched away his aircraft, namely Pushpaka, which aircraft transits at the wish of its steersman, and 
Shuurpanakha saw such a grabber of others possessions. [3-32-14b, 15a]


He who enviously devastated the divine gardens of Kubera, called Caitraratha, along with a divine Lake 
of Lotuses pertaining to the same Kubera, called Pushkarini, and the gardens of Indra, called Nandana, 
along with other paradisiacal gardens of gods, Shuurpanakha saw such an envious demon. [3-32-15b, 16a]


Shuurpanakha saw him who is similar to the pinnacle of a mountain, and who with his two hands 
forestalls the highly propitious ones that are the stiflers of their enemies, namely the Sun and Moon, when they tend to 
rise. [3-32-16b, 17a]


That courageous one who in early times has practised ascesis for ten thousand years in a great-forest, 
and who on accomplishing it has dedicated ten of his heads to the Self-Created Brahma, she saw such 
a Ravana with such ten heads. [3-32-17b, 18a]


Whereby, to whom there is an indemnity against death in war at the hand of gods, demons, gandharva-s, 
devils, birds, or reptiles, excepting humans, and Shuurpanakha saw such an unimperilled Ravana. [3-32-18b, 
19a]


He who is an extreme-ultraist that expropriates the Soma-juice-oblation form the vessels of oblation 
in Vedic-rituals, which Soma juice-oblation is blest with Vedic-hymns and kept separately by Vedic Brahmans, 
since it is intended and shall belong to Indra and other divinities, and she saw such a plunderer. [3-32-19b, 
20a]


He who is such an embezzler of the Vedic-rituals at the time of their culmination, a malicious one, 
and one with cruel acts, a hinderer of Vedic-rituals, or, the slayer of those Brahmans that conduct 
Vedic-rituals contrary to his wishes, and one who is heartless and a rampant demon, who is a delighter 
in the iniquity to the people, at him Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-20b, 21a]


She that demoness Shuurpanakha saw her brother who makes all beings to wail, an alarming one to all 
the worlds, an atrocious one and highly formidable Ravana. [3-32-21b, 22a]


And at him who is conspicuously sitting on a throne, attired and bejewelled in excellent apparels and 
jewels, shining forth with marvellous garlands, and who is like the Ultimate-Time on the rise destined 
for the Eventual-Time. [3-32-22b, 23a]


Demoness Shuurpanakha nearing Ravana, who is the highly fortunate king of demons, an enemy-destroyer 
and a felicity of the dynasty of Sage Pulasta, and who is now surrounded by his ministers, she spoke 
this sentence. [3-32-23b, 24]


She who is disfigured by the high souled Lakshmana, and who is still perplexed with the fear of Lakshmana 
and her own craving for Rama as well, on displaying her misfortune to everybody that fearless rover 
Shuurpanakha spoke this very caustic sentence to Ravana, whose eyes are broad and burning. [3-32-25]

To Rama, the scion of Raghu and her husband, who started out when permitted by Sage Suteekshna, Vaidehi 
spoke this with friendly words. [3-9-1]


"Gross unjust will accrue to any in an abstruse way if his indulgence is enkindled merely by his own 
desire, and in this world it is possible to fend them off, to have a recourse to justness... [3-9-2]


"Only three self-gratifications, the definite products of desire, are there: one is speaking fallacious 
utterances, which itself is worse, and worst than the other two malefic self-gratifications, where the 
other two are the fascination for other's wife, and the cruelness without enmity... [3-9-3, 4a]

j


Hunting, sleeping in daytime, abusing others, indulgence in women, three artistic impulses namely music, 
dance and drama, wasteful wandering, are the ten desire. Manu smriti.


"The habit of telling specious words is not there with you in the past nor it will be there in future, 
oh, Raghava, then wherefrom the virtue-ruining desire for other's women can be there... [3-9-4b, 5a]


"Oh, king, earlier this vile desire for other's women is absent in you, nor it is there now, unobserved 
is such a desire in any corner of your heart oh, prince, for you are always interested in your own wife... 
[3-9-5, 6]


"You are conscientious, adherent of truth, and obliging father's orders, and in you virtue and truth, 
nay everything is established in you... [3-9-7]


"Oh, dextrous one, all this can possibly be shouldered by one with controlled senses, and oh, graceful 
one for a gaze, I am also aware of your sense control... [3-9-8]


"That third tendency to torture others' lives without enmity, that which will usually be effectuated 
unwarily, has now suddenly chanced before you... [3-9-9]


"Intending to safeguard the sages you have promised the dwellers in Dandaka forest, oh, valiant one, 
that you would eliminate demons in a fight... [3-9-10]


"Only in this respect you have started towards the well-known Dandaka forest along with your brother, 
and wielding bow and arrows...[3-9-11]


"Then on seeing your starting my mind is apprehensively upset, on verily reflecting about your bearing 
there appears to be no beneficial good for you... [3-9-12]


"Oh, brave one, your going towards Dandaka forest is not delightful to me, I tell the cause for that 
and listen to it as I tell...[3-9-13]


"Indeed on entering the forest along with your brother, and wielding bow and arrows, seeing the forest 
ramblers there, won't you deplete arrows on all of them... [3-9-14]


"The bow of warrior and the fuel of a burning fire if available within their reach, they immensely enhance 
their strength... [3-9-15]


"Once upon a time, oh, dextrous one, there was a pious and true worded hermit in some merited forest 
that was wonted by animals and birds... [3-9-16]


"Then Indra came to that hermitage handling a sword, and donning a soldier's guise, to cause hindrance 
to that hermit's ascesis... [3-9-17]


"Indra gave that best sword to store, there in that hermitage to that sage who is lasting in his ascesis, 
on a redeemable basis... [3-9-18]


"On receiving that sword, he who is duteous in guarding the entrustment, moved about in the forest always 
handling the sword, to safeguard the confidence reposed in him... [3-9-19]


"Wherever that dedicated guardian of that entrustment goes, even to obtain tubers or fruits, he did 
not go without that sword... [3-9-20]


"Carrying that sword always, that hermit slowly made his own faculty infuriated, loosing determination 
in ascesis... [3-9-21]


"Then with the constant association of that weapon that sage gradually became inadvertent, and smitten 
by vice he went to hell... [3-9-22]


"Thus, all this happened earlier, only owing the reason of associating with a weapon constantly, and 
the sequel of constant association with weapon is as good as constant association with fire... [3-9-23]


"In affinity and in respect I am reminding but not tutoring you, and in anyway improper is that thought 
of yours to wield your bow to kill the demons dwelling in Dandaka without any enmity, oh, brave one, 
undesirable is the killing of offenceless... [3-9-24, 25]


"For the valiant Kshatriya-s who are inclined in forests heartily, the purpose of the bow is this much 
'safeguarding the sufferers...' [3-9-26]


"Where that weapon? Where this forest? Where the principles of Kshatriya? And where is sageness? All 
this is inconsistent... let us esteem the laws of the land... [3-9-27]


"Weapon admiring mind becomes maligned with avariciousness, you may therefore follow the tenet of Kshatriya-s 
on going to Ayodhya again... [3-9-28]


"Everlasting satisfaction will be there to my father-in-law and mothers-in-laws, on your becoming a 
devout sage even after forfeiture of kingdom... [3-9-29]


"From virtuousness prosperity emanates, from righteousness happiness, and by honourableness all are 
achieved, and this universe is the essence of probity... [3-9-30]


"Experts will make efforts to exhaust their own selves with those and those principles, thus they realise 
sublimity... unachievable is pleasure by pleasuring alone... [3-9-31]


"Always tread along the righteousness with a pure mind, oh, gentle one, and specially in these sagely 
forests... you know everything in all the three worlds, in all its nuances... [3-9-32]


"I cite all this with my womanly waver, and who is capable to talk to you about dharma? Ponder mindfully 
along with your brother, and what that is appropriate, you do it...but not belatedly... [3-9-33]


This particular chapter is an interesting juncture in Ramayana, 
where Seetha reminds about the question of triggering cause for Rama's waging a war against demons. 
Seetha's doubt is well explained in Dharmaakuutam, the encyclopaedic commentary on Ramayana. A number 
of pages are allotted there for this chapter, and it is said there, that if Seetha is said to be self-contradictory 
in telling Rama that bow and arrows are a must to Kshatriya-s to protect the helpless when saying 'safeguard 
the sufferers, then only Kshatriya-s should use their bow..." as at verse 3-9-26 above, and also questioning 
immediately at 3-9-27, 'where the Kshatriya dharma, where the hermit's way of living...' etc., dharmaakuutam 
says not so. She is not contradicting herself in her statements, but asking Rama to have a cause, without 
resorting to weaponry against those demons, in a straightforward way.
<em>ataH tad rakShaNaaya aayudhamna graahyam iti etad 
abhipraayakatvaat ||</em>


She is inquisitive to know 
why Rama alone shall raise the bow and arrows against some demons hurting some sages. These sages are 
having super powers and Indra like celestial chiefs are coming to these sages to take them to heaven 
with their mortal bodies. Can't they eliminate these demons? But these super hermits are not going to 
heaven, which is the minimum ambition of any penance, but requesting Rama to protect them from demons. 
And Rama obligingly started to wage this unilateral war, where any war requires a triggering point. 
Can't the super sages eliminate these demons, with their powers acquired by their penances? This is 
the question of Seetha. For this, Rama replies so convincingly in the next chapter, saying that the 
sages cannot issue forth a curse at the demons, in the course of their penance.

Sage Vishvamitra, though 
being a furious sage, once sought the help of Rama to counter the Demoness Tataka. And Rama rendered 
it. Now also these sages do not waste their powers at the mischievous demons, but ask Rama to safeguard 
their interests, for Rama is the king, whether he may be in capital or in forests.

Secondly, Rama is subjected 
to the throne of Ayodhya, now being held by his brother Bharata, and as a loyalist to that throne, Ram 
should act in accordance with the rules of his kingdom. This area Dandaka forests is under the ambit 
of their own kingdom. So Rama has to perform the deeds suitable to their kingdom. When killing Vali, 
Rama speaks to Vali -- "all this area is under our kingdom, now held by Bharata, and it is my duty 
to act in accordance with the decree of that throne..."

"Regarding the cause, Seetha's 
doubt comes true and she alone becomes the ultimate cause for Rama, to wage the final war with Ravana.

Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, on seeing the skyward flight of Ravana taking her
along became highly frantic and remaining in highest dismay she is distraught. [3-53-1]


Seetha whose eyes turned coppery-red with tears and resentment, still outpouring
tears while being abducted she piteously poured this scorn on that gory-eyed demon's chief, Ravana.
[3-53-2]


"You knave Ravana, you are taking flight on thieving me after prowling about my
loneliness, such as you are, are you not ashamed in the least for this subterfuge. [3-53-3]


"You black-hearted fiend, for sure, you alone sidelined my husband in a trickish
guise of Golden Deer wishful to abduct me as you are a coward. [3-53-4]


"Which king of eagles battled against you to bail me out, an old friend of my
father-in-law, such as he is he is also felled, indeed. [3-53-5]


"Ah, truly what an audacious audacity is shown by you... you basely demon... by
ear-shattering your great name saying that 'I am Ravana...' I am conquered in a combat -
Really?


"Am I conquered by you in a combat between my husband and you, wherein you on
announcing your name to my husband and truly showing your audacious audacity defeated my husband,
and thus triumphing over me - or what? Tell me, you mousy demon...


"Unable to conquer my husband in a combat, but able to earbash your name to a lonely
woman and abducting her, will this tantamount to your apparently audacious audacity? Thus, I am not
really triumphed over by a lowly demon like you... [3-53-6]


"A woman, that too a lonely one, that too the other man's wife, that too an
abduction, but not winning or wooing her... you knave, on your undertaking such a kind of
deplorable deed, how unashamed are you? [3-53-7]


"A self-glorifier as you are, this highly inhuman, iniquitous, imputable deed of
yours will be recounted by all men in all worlds. [3-53-8]


"Damn with what you have said then about your might and mettle... damn with this
kind of your demeanour which is lamentable to whole of your clan in this world. [3-53-9]


"What can be done possibly... why because you are fleeing very speedily in this
way... wait for a moment to ascertain whether you can go back in aliveness... [3-53-10]


"On your coming into the line of sight of those two princes, even if you are with
whole of your military, you will be incapacitated to live on, indeed even for a moment...
[3-53-11]


"Anywise it will be incapable of you to endure the touch of their arrows, as with a
bird that cannot endure the overly flaring up wildfire in a forest. [3-53-12]


"Oh, Ravana, positively contemplate in your soul and politely release me... and if
you do not release me, indeed by the rancour of insulting me, my husband along with his brother
devises your doom... [3-53-13, 14a]


"You rogue! By which endeavour you are desirous of thieving me under duress, that
endeavour of yours behoves absurd. [3-53-14b, 15a]


"Though I am in aliveness now, but on my going under the control of an enemy and on
unseeing godlike husband of mine I am indeed unenthused to bear up my lives for a long.
[3-53-15]


"Definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either that which is
worthwhile or that which is beneficial to you, as mortals undertake a quirkily behaviour at the
time of their death...


"At the time of their death mortals wish to enjoy noxious and non-recuperative
foods, thus definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either nontoxic or beneficial
nourishments for your well-being. [3-53-16b, 17a]


"But which is recuperative that is unpalatable to all of the death-rattlers, and
indeed, I behold you as one around whose throat the noose of Time is looped. [3-53-17b, 18a]


"As you are dauntless in this daunting situation as for yourself, oh, Decahedral
demon, indeed it is clear that you are clearly fantasising the ill-omened golden trees all around.
[3-53-18b, 19a]


"Oh, Ravana, you will see the ghastly River Vaitarani which will be tumultuously
streaming with blood streams, also thus you will see the grisly sword-leaved-forests in hell.
[3-53-19b, 20a]


"You will see silk-cotton trees flowered with molten gold, shrouded with lapis
gemlike melting leaves, and enshrouded with sharp irony thorns in hell. [3-53-20b, 21a]


"Oh, unmerciful one, on doing this kind of misdeed to that noble-souled Rama you are
incapable to bear up life for a long time like the one who quaffed venom. [3-53-21b, 22a]


"You are bound by the unpreventable lasso of the Time, oh, Ravana, on going where
you will get complacency from that uncompromising husband of mine? [3-53-22b, 23a]


"By whom fourteen thousand demons are killed in war just within a minute,
single-handedly without any help from his brother, how then that brave and mighty Raghava, an
expert in all kinds of missiles, will not eliminate you, the stealer of his chosen wife, with his
mordant arrows?" Thus Seetha poured forth her ire at Ravana. [3-53-23b, 24, 25a]


On saying this much and other exacting words, Vaidehi who has gone onto the flank of
Ravana, indeed lamented lamentably as her dismay is coalesced with her distress. [3-53-25b, c]


She who is highly agonised and weeping before talking, a ranter who ranted much, a
resentful lady who has come of age, and a pitiable whirler in the hands of demon whose whirligig
has transformed into spasmodic jerking of her body for deliverance from that sinner, and in that
way that sinner stole that princess Seetha. [3-53-26]

			This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Kishkindha Kanda in the attitudes of a king and 
			his kingship. These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with
			<em>raaja niiti shastra</em> 'political science' and there in Kishkindha the only 
			rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas in 
			here Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shuurpanakha. Though Shuurpanakha 
			is a sultry and harpy demoness, the Sage Valmiki has put some rational words on her tongue 
			in forewarning Ravana.


Then that doleful Shuurpanakha spoke these scornful words to Ravana who makes the world to wail in the 
presence of his ministers. [3-33-1]


"Highly infatuated with lustful gratifications you are incontinent and unchecked, thus you are unobservant 
of a calamitous jeopardy that has surfaced, though you ought to be observant of it as a king. [3-33-2]


"If a king deports himself in an overly self-assured manner, that too with self-serving motives, and 
clings only to dirty pleasures, he will be unhonoured by people as with a crematory fire. [3-33-3]


"The king who will not deal with the concerns of kingdom, in person and on time, he and his kingdom 
and even those concerns of his kingdom will get ruined. [3-33-4]


"If a king is inaccessible to spies for exchange of information, unavailable for subjects for an audience 
for a similar appraisal, more so if he is intemperately not able to impose self-discipline, people will 
eschew such a king from a distance as elephants will refrain themselves from the mud of river from a 
distance. [3-33-5]


"Which of those kings that will not safeguard their kingdoms by remaining in a self-restrained manner, 
they will not outshine advantageously, like mountains submerged under ocean. [3-33-6]


"Without keeping the kingdom under your personal control, you have shuffled the administration onto 
the ministers and army personnel like Khara, Duushana et al. And these figureheads alone become the 
tiderips, for they quarrel among themselves about the kingship of Lanka after your ruin, and they alone 
are floating like oceanic tides up above your head and thus you are a submerged sovereign. In any way, 
your doom is destined either by Rama, who is an imminent danger, or by your military managers, who are 
the in-built dangers."


"Externally you are belligerent with sensible gods, gandharva-s and other demons, and internally you 
are needful of intelligence agents, and such as you are, you are an erratic even, then how can you thrive 
as a king! [3-33-7]


"Your bent is boyish and you are mindless, oh, demon, you are not able to know the knowable danger because 
you are carefree, and how do you thrive as a king! [3-33-8]


"Oh, so-called best one among triumphant kings, those kings that do not retain spies, treasuries and 
strategies under their control, but vouchsafe them to others, they are of a piece with the peasantry. 
[3-33-9]


"Oh, titular overlord of humans, only some can be called prescient kings because they see all the situations 
happening distantly through their spies. [3-33-10]


"I believe that you have no spies worth their profession, yet you are associated with artless ministers 
worthy to worship you, hence you are incognisant of the ruination of all of your subjects in Janasthaana, 
including Janasthaana. [3-33-11]


"A single soul called Rama has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of dreadful deeds in Janasthaana, 
even Duushana is killed, even Khara is also killed. [3-33-12]


"That indefatigable champion Rama gave security to the sages, rendered Dandaka forest safeguarded, and 
he put Janasthaana to rout. [3-33-13]


"On your part you are but selfish, hotheaded, and others like the appeasers of your lust, or these artless 
ministers, or those underpaid unfaithful spies hold you down, and such as you are, you are unperceptive 
of the calamity rising up against you in your own kingdom. [3-33-14]


"Should a king be overweening, an under-payer, an improvident, self-conceited, and dubious, all his 
subjects bid goodbye to such a king when he is in strife. [3-33-15]


"Should a ruler be unduly self-conceited, self-centred, self-adulating and a spitfire too, his own kith 
and kin will ruin him when he is in distress. [3-33-16]


"That king who does not officiate his good offices, nor un-panicked into panicky situations, he will 
be quickly overthrown from his kingdom, and on becoming a debased individual he will be equated with 
a piece of straw in this world. [3-33-17]


"Dried sticks, globs or the particles of dust are of some avail, but kings fallen from their position 
are of no avail. [3-33-18]


"As to how a used up raiment or a crumpled flower-tassel is meaningless, likewise a king derelict from 
his kingdom, though functional, is meaningless. [3-33-19]


"Which king will be cautious, clever, conscientious, with his controlled senses, and thankful, that 
king survives for a long time. [3-33-20]


"He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness will be wakeful even though he slept well closing his physical 
eyes and he who will make his fury and favour evident to people without any concealment or cunningness, 
people will highly revere him as a king.


"He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness wakeful even though he sleeps fast closing his physical eyes, 
thus discarded are his fury and frenzy as well, because he knows as to who is to be treated furiously 
and who is to be favoured, and thus people will revere him as a judicious king. [3-33-21]


"But, oh, Ravana, because you are imprudent you are bereft of these merits, and such as you are, unknown 
is the very great massacre of demons to you, though not personally, but at least through your spies. 
[3-33-22]


"You are the humiliator of others, you hobnob only with your ravishes, and incognisant of the object 
for apportionment of time and place for your activities, as to when and where and how the things are 
to be dealt with. And, as you are not attending any kingly activity, or do not focus your mind in deciding 
rights and wrongs, thereby your kingdom will get ruined and you will be imperilled, not before long." 
Thus Shuurpanakha declaimed Ravana about his worthlessness as a king. [3-33-23]


In this way when Shuurpanakha extolled only his negative traits, he that lord of night-walkers Ravana, 
who holds only his pride, power and prosperity dear to him, pored them over in his mind and contemplated 
over a time. [3-33-24]

On entering the hermitage Lakshmana, the younger brother of Raghava, reached Agastya's disciple and 
spoke this sentence to him. [3-12-1]


"A king named Dasharatha was there, his eldest son and the dynamic one, Rama has arrived along with 
his wife Seetha to see the sage. [3-12-2]


"I am his loyal, dedicated, and adherent younger brother named Lakshmana, if ever you have heard of 
us. [3-12-3]


"Such as we are, we entered the awful forest at the decree of our father, and we wiush to see the godly 
sage, let this be informed to him." Said Lakshmana to the disciple of Agastya. [3-12-4]


On hearing that sentence of Lakshmana that disciple who is ascetically rich replied 'agreed, ' and he 
entered the sanctum of Ritual-fire to submit the same to Agastya. [3-12-5]


He that agreeable disciple of sage quickly approached the irrefutable sage by his asceticism, made palm-fold 
and said this to the eminent sage about about the arrival of Rama, exactly as said by Lakshmana. [3-12-6, 
7a]


"Sons of King Dasharatha, Rama and also thus Lakshmana have entered the threshold of hermitage along 
with the wife of Rama, namely Seetha. [3-12-7b, 8a]


"Those two enemy-destroyers have come cherishing to see and serve you, hence it will be apt of you to 
order what next is to be done in this regard." Said disciple to the sage. [3-12-8b, 9a]


Having heard from the disciple that Rama has arrived with Lakshmana and with highly fortunate Seetha 
the sage said this to him. [3-12-9b, 10a]


"My heart is indeed yearning for his arrival, and after this long a time Rama providentially came to 
see me." [3-12-10b, 11a]


"Go forth and make welcome to Rama, Lakshmana and to Seetha, and they be entered here, why you have 
not invited them as yet? [3-12-11b, 12a]


Thus said by the great-souled sage and the knower of virtue, the disciple adored him with palm-fold 
saying that "as you say." [3-12-12b, 13a]


Then that disciple went out with a little perplexity and said this to Lakshmana, "Where is this Rama? 
He may come to see the sage and let him enter hermitage on his own." Said that disciple to Lakshmana. 
[3-12-13b, 14a]


Then on going out to the exterior of that hermitage along with that disciple, Lakshmana has shown him 
Rama and Janaka's daughter Seetha. [3-12-14b, 15a]


While that disciple repeated the obliging words of Agastya entered that reception-worthy Rama into hermitage 
on receiving him well. [3-12-15b, 16a]


And then Rama entered the hermitage with Seetha and Lakshmana looking over it which is overspread with 
docile deer. [ 3-12-16b, 17a]


Rama entered inside the hermitage and saw therein the sanctus of Brahma, Fire-god, Vishnu, Indra, Vivasvat 
- the Sun-god, Soma - the Moon-god, Bhaga - one among the twelve Suns, and the sanctusms of Kubera, 
[Wealth-Management-god, are seen and passed by the three of them, sanctums of Dhaata, Vidhaata - Vedic 
deities created by Brahma to help Svayambhuu Manu, santucm of Vaayu - the Air-god, and also like that 
the sanctum of great-soloed VaruNa - the Rain-god who also wields noose, and the sanctum of Gayatri 
- the presiding deity of gnosis, sanctum of Vasus - eight of them, and the sanctum of cobra's king - 
aadi sheSa, the divine Thousand-headed serpent that bears this globe on its head, and on which Vishnu 
reclines, and even the sanctum of GaruDa - the Divine Eagle and the vehicle of Vishnu, and the half 
brother of aadi sheSa, and the sanctum of Kaartikeya - chief of gods army, second son of Shiva, and 
the sanctum of Dharma - Dharmaraaja, presiding deity of Virtue-Vice-Time of living beings, in-charge 
of the hell. [17b, 18, 19, 20, 21a]


Then encircled by disciples the sage Agastya came out quickly, and Rama saw him who is glowing brilliant 
before all the other sages. [3-12-21b, 22a]


On seeing the brilliantly glowing sage among those sages, he that bold Rama said this sentence to Lakshmana, 
the fortifier of fortune, "Here comes the godly sage, Lakshmana, by his eminence I comprehend him as 
a depository of all ascesis." [3-12-22b, 23]


That dexterous Rama on saying about that sun-like radiant sage Agastya, he that descendent of Raghu 
fell on the feet of Agastya touching them reverentially. [3-12-24]


Then he who is a delight to the on lookers that noble-hearted Rama on revering the sage along with Lakshmana 
and Seetha, the princess from Videha, stood aside with his palms adjoined. [3-12-25]


Offering seat and water that sage received Rama, and even on exchanging pleasantries that sage said 
to him, "please be seated." [3-12-26]


Having completed his personal worship to Fire-god, and having offered water and other formalities to 
guest, that sage gave viands to guests according to his hermitic observances. [3-12-27]


Then that eminent and shrewd sage Agastya in righteousness took his seat at the outset, and spoke to 
prudent Rama of righteousness itself, and who by now is sitting with his palms adjoined. [3-12-28]


"Worshipping the fire, giving water and worshipping the guest a hermit should receive a guest and feed 
him, and if a hermit practices contrarily, oh, Rama, he is destined to eat his own flesh like a false 
deponent in other world say, hell. [3-12-29]


"You are the king of all the world, the treader in the path of righteousness, great charioteer of probity, 
and you are the venerable and estimable one, and you have arrived as my dear guest. [3-12-30]


Saying thus, Agastya adored Raghava well with fruits, tubers, flowers and others according to his ardency, 
and then he said this to Rama. [3-12-31]


"This sacred bow that is decorated with gold and diamonds is crafted by the divine architect Vishvakarma 
pertains to Vishnu, and these unwasteful arrows equalling sun in their blaze are the gift of Brahma. 
[3-12-32, 33a]


"Also these two inexhaustible quivers packed with arrows that have the blaze of Ritual-fire, and this 
sword decorated in gold together with its sheath made up of excellent golden are once given to me by 
Indra. [3-12-33b, 34]


"By this bow, oh, Rama, once Vishnu eliminated horrible demons in war and brought back radiant prosperity 
to the celestials. [3-12-35]


"The bow, these two quivers, arrows, and the sword, oh, Rama, the endower of grace, receive and wield 
them to triumph over the demons as Indra would wield Thunderbolt. [3-12-36]


On saying thus that great resplendent and godly sage Agastya, gave all of those best weapons to Rama, 
and again spoke to Rama [3-12-37]

"Oh, great dextrous Rama with great daring and dashing, as to how the physique of sun, moon, and even 
that of Indra is there now, my physique was also like that earlier, an unbelievable mien and renowned 
in all the three worlds... [3-71-1, 2a]


"Such as I was with an admirable body, disguising myself in this kind of horrendous form which is utterly 
dreadful to the world, I was scaring the forest living sages, there and there... [3-71-2]


"On one day, when a great sage named Sthuulashira was collecting divers forest produce for his Vedic-ritual, 
I scared him with this ugly form and I even exasperated him... [3-71-3b, 4a]


"On seeing me that sage who is an enforcer of deadly curse cursed me in this way, 'that which is presently 
diabolic and despicable form of yours, hereinafter you will abide in this form alone...' [3-71-4b, 5a]


"When I begged that enraged sage as, 'even if I have committed this blasphemy owing to my blasphemous 
fate, will there be an end to this blasphemed form of mine, or not...' and then he spoke this word to 
me... [3-71-5b, 6a]


" 'When Rama incinerates you in an uninhibited forest on chopping off your shoulders, then you will 
regain your own grand and auspicious form...' So said the sage to me... [3-71-6b, 7a]


"Oh, Lakshmana, you may know as the most handsome son of Danu, and this misshapen form has chanced on 
me owing the ire of Indra in battlefield... [3-71-7b, 8a]


"I have gladdened Grandparent Braham with severe ascesis and He granted longevity to me, and then a 
kind of recalcitrance touched off in my mind... [3-71-8b, 9a]


" 'When longevity is acquired by me what Indra can do to me...' thus relying upon that kind of certitude, 
I jousted with Indra in a bout... [3-71-9b, 10a]


"But the Thunderbolt that has a hundred cutting edges and that which is launched from Indra's hand has 
rammed by head and thighs into my body... [3-71-10b, 11a]


"When I begged of him saying, 'lead me to the hell of Yama, rather than making me to live this hell 
of a body...' Then Indra said this to me, 'Let the Grandparent Brahma's word about your longevity come 
true...' Thus Indra spared me to me... [3-71-11b, 12a]


" 'By the impaction of Thunderbolt disarranged are my thighs and head, thereby my mouth went into my 
stomach... and without thighs how can I prowl, without arms how can I scrabble, and without a mouth 
how can I guzzle... and how am I capable to live on, and even that living too, is destined for too long 
a time...' [3-71-12b, 13a]


"When I said to Indra this way, Indra devised for me yojana long arms, also that way a rapier-fanged 
mouth in my paunch... [3-71-13b, 14a]


"Such as I am, I have been eating the lions, elephants, animals, and tigers that are on the move in 
this forest, hauling them in with both of my overlong arms... [3-71-14b, 15a]


"Indra has also said to me, 'as and when Rama hacks off your arms along with Lakshmana in a conflict, 
then you can go to heaven...' Thus Indra said to me and vanished. [3-71-15b, 16a]


"Oh, sire, I am grabbing whatever I see in this forest while living with this body... oh, powerful king, 
as I feel it meetly and a must for me... [3-71-16b, 17a]


"I believed that Rama will certainly come nigh of my captivity, and confiding myself in this kind of 
determination, presaged by sage Sthuulashira, as well... I have been toiling to dislodge this body... 
[3-71-17b, 18a]


"Oh, Raghava, as to how this has happened in this way according to the sum and substance told by the 
sage Sthulashira, you alone are that Rama, let safe betide you, and none other than you is capable to 
mangle me... [3-71-18b, 19a]


"Oh, impetuous man Rama, if I were to be beatified by you two by incinerating me in Fire, I will advice 
you about the next course of your action... I will further advise you about your prospective friend..." 
So said Kabandha to Rama. [3-71-19b, 20a]


When Raghava is said thus by that Kabandha, the heir of Danu, that duty-minded Rama said this word to 
Kabandha while Lakshmana is hearing. [3-71-20b, 21a]


"Ravana conveniently stole my illustrious wife when myself and my brother exited from Janasthaana... 
[3-71-21b, 22a]


"I only know his name but not the form of that demon... and we are unaware either of his stronghold 
or of his staying power... [3-71-22b, 23a]


"It will be apt of you to show befitting mercy on us who are anguished by agony, running all over helter-skelter 
like unsheltered ones, and we who will be compliant for your restitution... [3-71-23b, 24a]


"Oh, brave Kabandha, on bringing dried up firewood that was rent at times by elephants, and on digging 
a large trench, we will incinerate you in it... [3-71-24b, 25a]


"Such as you are, if you actually know who stole Seetha, or whereto she is stolen, either... you clearly 
inform of her when incinerated, thus you will be rendering a most gracious deed to me, and to all concerned..." 
Thus Rama made clear of his case. [3-71-25b, 26a]


When he is said thus that expert articulator Kabandha replied Rama, who is also an expert enunciator, 
with expedient words. [3-71-26b, 27a]


"There is no divine knowledge to me as of now... nor I can identify Maithili... but when I am burnt 
I assume my own original divine form, and then I will be able tell about him, who will find her out... 
[3-71-27b, 28a]


"With this unburnt body, oh, Rama, I indeed have no ability to discern anything, hence oh, lord, I will 
be able to speak about him who can familiarise you with that great mighty demon, by whom your Seetha 
is stolen, only after that incineration... [3-71-28b, 29]


"Oh, Raghava, utterly distorted is my acumen, indeed, by the blemish of curse... and this form which 
is despicable to world has bechanced only because of my own antics... [3-71-30]


"Oh, Rama, soon you have to toss me into trench to burn me customarily, sooner than the Sun's going 
to Mt. Dusk when his horses are fatigued... [3-71-31]


"Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, when I am scripturally burnt by you in a trench, oh, great valiant 
Rama, for sure, I will tell of him, who can quiet fathom that demon... [3-71-32]


"Oh, Raghava, you have to befriend him with an amicable comportment... and that valiantly alacritous 
one will be gladdened by the sequel of your friendship, and he will evolve a succour to you... [3-71-33]


"Oh, Raghava, nothing is there in all the three worlds that is unfamiliar to him, for he circumnavigated 
all worlds once, in a different context... [3-71-34]

A massy and tumultuous ass-coloured cloud rained ill-omened bloody water while that fiendish force is 
advancing. [3-23-1]


The highly speedy horses paired to Khara's chariot have tottered in a trice, even though that place 
on the highway is with even surface and spread with flowers. [3-23-2]


Capturing the sun a blackish corona with blood-red outer circle has formed and nested around it 
like the fiery ring formed by circling a fireball. [3-23-3]


Then, nearing the golden shaft of the flag of the chariot with a very lofty flagstaff, an awful eagle 
with massive body occupied and perched atop of that golden shaft. [3-23-4]


Cacophonous and carnivorous predators and vultures took over the nearby places of Janasthaana and they 
made raucous sounds of many kinds. [3-23-5]


Turning towards the stretch scorched by the sun, fearsome and loud noised jackals have howled emitting 
awful sounds, that which is inauspicious to the demons. [3-23-6]


Then frightening clouds similar to bursting mountains carrying bloodlike water have rendered the firmament 
less of leeway. [3-23-7]


There chanced an abominable, cataclysmic, hair-raising darkness whereby the milieus or inter-milieus 
are not very clearly brightened. [3-23-8]


An untimely eventide glistened with a colour similar to the one drenched in blood, and then horrendous 
brutes and birds have clamoured facing Khara directly, and the vultures, jackals and eagles too have 
screamed portending danger. [3-23-9, 10a]


Jackals, that too female jackals, are always the agents of inauspiciousness in wars with demonstrable 
calamities brought forth by their portending howling, and such jackals have now howled in front of Khara's 
army with their snouts spewing blazes. [3-23-10]


A spherical object like that of a human trunk is revealed near at the sun, while the sun is rendered 
shineless as though Rahu, the great eclipsing-planet, has eclipsed him inopportunely, and the wind too 
whirled frantically. [3-23-11b, 12]


Stars sprang up with the brilliance of fireflies though it is not night, and at that moment fishes and 
waterfowls stood still in lakes, lotuses have dried up, flowers and fruits have dropped from trees as 
though it is night. [3-23-13, 14a]


Without any puffing of wind dust in brownish-red colour is heaved up, and there the songbirds like Maina 
started to twitter as 'cii cii kuu cii'. [3-23-14b, 15a]


Meteors horrible in their look have fallen down thunderously, and even the earth together with its mountains, 
woods and forests quaked shakily. [3-23-15b, 16a]


He who is raving while sitting in his chariot that clever Khara's left shoulder thrilled excessively, 
and his voice too quavered. [3-23-16b, 17a]


While he is seeing everywhere his eyes spawned tears for no good reason, his forehead ached, but he 
did not retrace his steps owing to his own vanity. [3-23-17b, 18a]


On observing those worst auguries stemming up at that moment with hair-raising nature, Khara laughed 
them off and said this to all of the demons. [3-23-18b, 19a]


"These awful auguries with their horrible nature have arisen, but owing to my own valour I am unbothered 
about all of them as with a mighty one unworried of the mightless. [3-23-19b, 20a]


"With the excruciating arrows of mine I can hurtle stars from the face of sky, and if highly infuriated, 
I can even enjoin mortality to Death himself. [3-23-20b, 21a]


"I am reluctant to return without killing that Rama, a haughty one by his might, together with his brother 
Lakshmana, with my incisive arrows. [3-23-21b, 22a]


"In whose respect both Rama and Lakshmana behaved perversely, let that sister of mine be contented in 
drinking the blood of those two. [3-23-22b, 23a]


"No defeat has chanced on me in combats at anytime and anywhere, that to you all is obvious and I tell 
no untruth. [3-23-23b, 24a]


"If I am infuriated I can eliminate even the king of gods, wielder of Thunderbolt and a trekker on ruttish 
elephant Iravata, namely Indra in a war, then why talk about these two humans." Thus Khara addressed 
his troops. [3-23-24b, 25a]


On hearing that thundering speech of Khara that sizeable army of demons which is tied down by the noose 
of death obtained an incomparable rejoice. [3-23-25b, 26a]


Then desiring to see the war of Khara with Rama, great-souls like sages, gods, gandharva-s along with 
carana-s and siddha-s have come together in firmament. [3-23-26b, 27a]


On gathering at a place those great souls met one another and said, "let good betide cows, Brahmans 
and those that are held respectful by the people at large." [3-23-27b, 28a]


"Let Raghava triumph over these mighty night walkers from the lineage of Pulastya, as with Vishnu who 
once conquered all the mighty demons in war." So said celestials to one another. [3-23-28]


While the great sages are speaking about this and many other topics, they and the gods abiding in their 
aircrafts have inquisitively seen the flow of army of demons, whose longevity is now beyond hope. [3-23-29, 
30]


Khara speedily bolted in his chariot to the van of his legions, and on seeing that demon Khara going 
in front other important demons too rushed to fore. They are Shyenagaami, Prithugviira, Yajnashatru, 
Vihamgama and also Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, 
Rudhiraaksha. These twelve highly valorous demons cruised in a semicircle around Khara. [3-23-31]


Likewsie Mahakapaala, Stuulaaksha, Pramaathii, Trishira are the four commanders of demonic forces and 
they followed Duushana marching at his behind. [3-23-33]


That army of valiant demons which is highly execrable, infernally speedy, and readily inspirited for 
a battle quickly rushed towards those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, as though a festoon of planets 
would rush towards the Moon and Sun so as to put them to rout. [3-23-34]

When Kabandha said that way, both those brave men and lords of people, on throwing the body of Kabandha 
into a mountain cleft and then embedded it with firewood. [3-72-1]


On his part Lakshmana started to torch that pyre with highly sparkling torches from all over, and even 
that pyre too suddenly blazed with blazes from all over. [3-72-2]


That massy body of Kabandha is full with fat and while it is being cooked, it is in simile with a massy 
gob of ghee. But the Fire had to stew that body tardily, though that stewed meat is Fire's favourite 
dish, because of that body's massiveness. [3-72-3]


In a trice that highly dynamic Kabandha zoomed up shoving off that pyre, and he is now attired in lily-white 
vestments and angelic garlands, and appeared like a fumeless fire. [3-72-4]


Then highly gladdened Kabandha jumped up onto sky from the pyre, and there he is irradiant with unsullied 
clothing, and fineries decorated on every limb. [3-72-5]


On going to firmament Kabandha is now seated in a dazzling celestial aircraft yoked with swans, which 
endows renown because it takes the occupants to the realms of Brahma, and sitting in that celestial 
aircraft he said this sentence to Rama, while his own great glimmer and glitter beamed forth in all 
ten quarters. [3-72-6, 7]


"Oh, Raghava, how you will regain Seetha, that you listen from me in its essence... oh, Rama, by which 
and which analyses everything will be analysed, six of such ideations are available in this world... 
and when a person is touched down by a spell of nemeses, he shall adore one who is equally in such spell 
of nemesis... [3-72-7b, 8]


"Oh, Rama, you along with Lakshmana went into a spell of nemesis, and thus you have become an underprivileged 
one, and that spell alone has obtained you this dire straits, in the form of abducting your wife... 
[3-72-9]


"Oh, best among kind-hearted ones, thereby you have to certainly befriend such a soul in similar dire 
straits... however deeply I may think, I am not able to perceive your accomplishment if you do not befriended 
with such a soul... [3-72-10]


"Oh, Rama, listen what I tell... a vanara is there by name Sugreeva, who is vengefully reneged by his 
brother Vali, the son of Indra... [3-72-11]


"That self-respectful valiant Sugreeva is living on the Mt. Rishyamuka, a best mountain available in 
the lambent fringes of Pampa Lake, along with four other vanara-s. [3-72-12]


"He that Sugreeva is a masterful one among vanara-s, highly mettlesome, self-resplendent, and illimitable 
is his self-radiance... and he is also truth-bound and culture-bound... a mastermind, master-hand and 
a taskmaster... [3-72-13]


"He is a capable adventurer, a courageous exploiter and incomparable one in intrepidity and a brave 
one in incursions, and his personality will be coruscating ever and anon, for he is the son of Sun-god... 
but he is banished by his self-conceited brother owing to the reasons of kingdom... [3-72-14]


"Oh, Rama, he will be your associate and an aid in searching for Seetha, and he conducts himself in 
your wellbeing, hence let not your heart yield to agony... [3-72-15]


"Oh, tigerly Ikshvaaku, further nothing can be countermanded in this world which is indeed ineluctable, 
and it is impossible to countervail against Time, isn't it... [3-72-16]


"Oh, bold one, you go straight from here to that great mighty Sugreeva, and oh, Raghava, on going from 
here now and promptly you fraternise with Sugreeva... and to not to bode any ill of unfriendliness among 
you two, you make him a friend before blazing Fire, making that Fire as an Attestor of your friendship... 
[3-72-17, 18a]


"You shall not look down on that lord of monkeys taking him as a lowly simian, why because that Sugreeva 
is a valiant one, a guise changing wizard and presently he is in the need of a bolsterer, and if you 
render help he will be obligated to you for ever... [3-72-18b, 19]


"Now you two are capable enough to effectuate the desired task of Sugreeva, isn't it... whether his 
own purpose is achieved through you or not, he will effectuate your task... [3-72-19b, 20a]


"Sugreeva is the son of Riksharaja, and the direct son of the Sun, but Vali trespassed against him. 
Wary of Vali's onslaughts Sugreeva is wandering around Pampa... [3-72-20b, 21a]


"Oh, Raghava, right away and candidly you make that monkey Sugreeva, a wanderer in the forest, sheltering 
himself on Mt. Rishyamuka, as a friend of yours taking an oath on your weapon besides the Fire-witness... 
[3-72-21b, 22a]


"With his expertise that straightforward monkey Sugreeva is indeed conversant with all of the strongholds 
of anthropophagite demons in the world in their entirety... [3-72-22b, 23a]


"Oh, enemy-subjugator Rama, as far as the thousand rayed sun manifestly irradiates the world, oh, Raghava, 
thus far, nothing in the least is unfamiliar to him, isn't it... [3-72-23b, 24a]


"He makes the monkeys to purposefully rake over the expansive rivers, extensive mountains and their 
impassable cliffs and caves in locating your wife... [3-72-24b, 25a]


"Oh, Raghava, he expedites giant bodied monkeys in all directions to search for her, who is agonised 
by your parting, and he quests after the residence of Ravana for that comely lady Maithili... [3-72-25b, 
26]


"Whether that unreprovable ladylove of yours, Seetha, is located on the tops of Mt. Meru's peaks, or 
abiding on the planes of nadir of the earth, he that defiant one among fly-jumpers, Sugreeva, on entering 
there and annihilating the demons, he again bestows Seetha to you..." So Kabandha continued his advise 
to Rama regarding Sugreeva. [3-72-27]

Rama arrives at the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna, as directed by Sage Sharabhanga in 
the previous chapter and asks the sage to show a place to dwell. Suteekshna asks Rama to stay at his 
own hermitage, which has no other problems than the wild animals that come in herds and make blaring 
noises. Rama wishes to kill those animals that hamper the tranquillity of hermits living therein, but 
having observed the kindness of Suteekshna towards those wild animals, however disturbing they may be, 
Rama refrains to kill them, and would like to go to any other place than this. They spend that night 
there.

Rama, the enemy-scorcher, has gone towards the threshold of the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna 
along with his brother Lakshmana and Seetha, also along with those Brahmans who accompanied him all 
the way. [4-7-1]

He travelling on a long way, and on crossing rivers with plenty of waters has seen a 
tranquil mountain towering like great Mt. Meru. [3-7-2]

Then those best ones from Ikshvaku dynasty, those two Raghava-s along with Seetha have 
entered the forest which will always be full with diverse trees. [3-7-3]

Entering that perilous forest with its many a flower and fruit bearing trees, they have 
seen the hermitage in a reclusive place adorned with rows of jute cloths as though garlanding it. [3-7-4]

There on seeing the ascetically rich Sage Suteekshna sitting in yogic posture with his 
body bearing lotus-like blotches of soil, Rama dutifully spoke to him. [3-7-5]

"Oh! godly sage I am Rama, I have come to see you, hence oh, knower of virtue, oh, great 
sage, oh, one with truthfulness as your courage, please talk to me..." [3-7-6]

Then that sage having seen that brave and best proponent of virtue, Rama, embraced him 
with both of his hands, and spoke this sentence. [3-7-7]

"Welcome to you Rama, best of Raghu dynasty and the best patron of truth, and when you 
presently caught this hermitage unprepared this has become a well-lorded one... [3-7-8]

"I am awaiting for you only, oh, greatly renowned one, without my ascent to heavens by 
casting off this body on the earth's plane, oh, brave one, for I have heard that you have arrived at 
Chitrakuta after you are repudiated from your kingdom... [3-7-9]

"The king of gods and the chief invitee in hundred sacrifices Indra approached me, and 
that great deity said me that I have conquered all the worlds by my meritorious deeds... [3-7-10, 11]

"Let me bequeath those worlds that are cherished by gods and sages alike, but which are 
won over by me by my ascesis, and you enjoy in them with your wife and with your brother Lakshmana... 
[3-7-12]

That self-respecting Rama replied the radiant sage with intense asceticism, a great soul 
and an advocate of truth by himself, as Indra would reply to Brahma. [3-7-13]

"I alone can gain all those worlds, oh, great saint, I now seek a place to dwell here 
in this forest as indicated by you... [3-7-14]

"You are an expert in all affairs, and you are interested in the welfare of all the beings, 
so said the great souled Sage Sharabhanga of Sage Gautama's dynasty..." [So said Rama to the sage.] 
[3-7-15]

When said thus by Rama, that great sage with world renown spoke sweet worded sentence 
with great pleasure. [3-7-16]

"You can take delight in this good featured hermitage alone, for groups of sages will 
always be moving here, and this always contains tubers and fruits..." Thus said Sage Suteekshna. [3-7-17]

"But herds of very large animals will be coming to this hermitage, they return after 
scaring us, of course without killing anyone, and they fear none... [3-7-18]

"Know that no other problem is there other than the animals..." So said the sage. On 
hearing those words of that great sage, that brave elder brother of Lakshmana taking bow and arrow said 
this sentence. [3-7-19, 20a]

"I will eradicate them, oh, greatly blessed one, those animals that will come collectively 
in herds with sharp edged, curve-end arrows... [3-7-20b, 21a]

"But you may be more interested in those animals mercifully, then what will be there 
more painful to you, hence I deem our staying in this hermitage for along will be unbefitting..." So 
said Rama. [3-7-21b, 22a]

On saying thus to the sage then Rama came by the twilight, and he paused at it. On worshipping 
the westward vesperal time, Rama arranged a stay for himself along with Seetha and Lakshmana, there 
in that delightful hermitage of Sage Suteekshna. [3-7-22b, 23]

Then the great soul Sage Suteekshna on completing his evening rituals and on observing 
the fall of night he himself courteously served food that is auspicious and worthy of sages to two of 
the best men, Rama and Lakshmana. [3-7-23]

In
<font color="#B3003A">aascharya raamayana</font> , another traditional rendering of this epic, it is 
said that Rama, while staying at this hermitage when night advanced, went out of the hermitage and killed 
all those animals. Not the above mentioned deer, but very big, blaring animals. The thrust of his arrows 
made the carcasses of those massive animals fall before the demon Kabandha. Kabandha is a cursed angle 
and will be released of his curse later by Rama. This Kabandha has no body parts below his chest, but 
has long hands with which he captures his prey that comes within the ambit of his long and strong hands. 
Kabandha is thus fed upon the kill of Rama, because Kabandha is a keynote character in giving information 
to Rama, and he is to be kept alive till such time. But all this is unknown to other in-mates of the 
hermitage, including Seetha. The next morning Rama, in a personal conversation with Seetha, reveals 
what he has done during the previous night, to her surprise and praise.

On directing those eight ghastly demons Ravana is amused in his heart of hearts that he has accomplished 
a great feat. [3-55-1]


On continually musing upon Vaidehi Ravana is tormented with the arrows of Love-god, thereby to lay eyes 
on Seetha he post-hastily entered the beautiful palace. [3-55-2]


On entering the palace-chamber that supremo of demons beheld Seetha overwhelmed with ruefulness amongst 
demonesses. [3-55-3]


She whose visage is brimming over with tears, one browbeaten and downtrodden with the burden of bewail, 
one capsized like a boat that is about to capsize in an ocean spreadeagled with whirlwinds, and one 
alike an impala altogether swerved from its herd of impala yet hemmed in with dog-wolves, that nightwalker 
came nigh of such a Seetha whose face is downcast unwilling to see any, and to such a pitiable Seetha 
who is in the shackles of her sorrow, that supremo of demons compellingly started to show his palace 
which is similar to any paradisiacal palace. [3-55-4, 5, 6]


That paradisiacal mansion house of Decahedral Ravana is congestive with innumerable cupolaed skyscrapers, 
adored with thousands of females, frequented by diverse bevies of birds, and it comprised of numerous 
gemstones. The pillars are amazingly gilded with engraving of ivory, gilt, quartz, silvern linocuts, 
and they are even embossed with diamonds and with lapis gems, which are heart-pleasing for a look. The 
drumbeats of divine drums are echoing in entire palace, and its archways are adorned with the gildings 
of pure gold. [3-55-7, 8, 9a]


Ravana walked up the wonderful golden staircase along with Seetha, and the rows of skyscrapers with 
windows that are ivoried and silvered and with window-blinds are seen from the windows of the landing 
on that flight of stairs, which are also ivoried and silvered windows with window-blinds, and all are 
amusing for sight. [3-55-9b, 10]


That Decahedral Ravana displayed the multiple stories of his own palace which is all over white-marbled 
and diamond encrusted to Maithili. [3-55-11]


Ravana continued to display the descendible wellsprings and leisure pools from which diverse flowers 
have sprung and overspread them, regardless of Seetha's languishing under her anguish. [3-55-12]


On flaunting his best palace in its entirety to Vaidehi that dirty-minded Ravana spoke this sentence 
to Seetha in order that she may be tempted on her own, lustily. [3-55-13]


"Oh, Seetha, ten crores of first-rated demons are there, furthermore, twenty-two crores of demons of 
ghastly exploits are there, thus all put together, three hundred twenty millions of demons are there 
in Lanka, omitting the weakish, oldish, youngish demons. For all of them I am the lord." Thus Ravana 
started his self-eulogy. [3-55-14, 15a]


"For every single work of mine a thousand servitors will rush in. Such as I am I pledge entire life 
of mine along with the suzerainty of this sovereign city-state Lanka to you, oh, broad-eyed lady, for 
you are loftier than my lives. [3-55-15b, 16]


"Oh, Seetha, you will become an empress for all of the those countless females of finest fabric amassed 
by me, oh, dear, if only you marry me. [3-55-17]


"You be keen on my amiable words and it will be apt of you to show compassion on me, for I have burning 
desire for you, and of what use is your thinking conversely about that long-lost Rama? [3-55-18]


"It is impossible to assail this Lanka even for Indra with all of the gods and demons, as an ocean roundly 
enshrouds this Lanka which is hundred-yojana-s witdthwise. [3-55-19]


"I behold none matchable to my vitality is existent among gods; among yaksha-s - no; among gandharva-s 
- no; among sages - no, nor anyone in any world. [3-55-20]


"What can you achieve with that dethroned, hapless, seer, vagrant Rama who is short-lived, for after 
all, he is a human with littlest vitality? [3-55-21]


"Oh, Seetha, you apotheosise me only for I am your seemliest husband, oh, jumpy lady, indeed, primeness 
has impermanence, thus here you be blithesome with me. [3-55-22]


"Oh, beautifully visaged lady, it is needless to have half a mind to see that Raghava, oh, Seetha, even 
if his wits chariot him what is his calibre to come thither crossing an un-crossable ocean? [3-55-23]


"It is impossible to knot the currents of cyclonic gusts in mid air, more so, it is impracticable to 
lay hold on the tongues of radiately irradiant fire. [3-55-24]


"Oh, benefactress of bliss, he who can lead you back with his valour, while you are being fended off 
by my mighty arms, him I do not envisage even in any one world of this threefold world. [3-55-25]


"You rule over this very great empire of Lanka as an empress of Lanka, while me and mine, also thus 
all gods like me who hitherto are under my rule, and all mobile and sessile entities of whom I am the 
ruler, they too will hereafter make ourselves useful as your royal stewards, if you marry me. [3-55-26]


"Wet with the waters of anointment you be elated and then delight me. By your damnable dwelling in forests 
bygone is your bad-luck that you misdealt in bygone times. And what dutiable good deed is to be done 
by you in marrying me, you do that now, and secure the fruits of that good deed here by marrying me. 
[3-55-27, 28a]


"Oh, Maithili, here all the garlands are divinely fragranced and the jewellery is topmost, you will 
dress up with them along with me should you become my wife. [3-55-28b]


"Oh, well-waisted lady, just by my might I notched up an aircraft known as Pushpaka from my brother 
Kubera in a war with him, which is similar sun in its shine. [3-55-29b. 30a]


"That aircraft is expansive and exhilarating, also its speed is on par with intuition, oh, Seetha, in 
that you can cheerfully fly about along with me, should you marry me. [3-55-30b, 31a]


"Oh, lady with a comely countenance, your visage is lotus similar in its shine, besides being immaculate, 
fairish and eyeful, but oh, curvaceous lady, with such a mushily maudlin of such a face this palace 
of mine is unbright, thus marry me to brighten everything" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-55-31b, 32a]


While Ravana is speaking to her in this way that graceful lady Seetha veiled her moonier face with fringe 
of her sari, and stiflingly dispelled tears on that mooniest face behind her half-veil. [3-55-32b, 33a]


To her who is disconcerted and whose anguish marred her brilliance and who is appearing as though pondering 
over the question of her submittal to Ravana, or otherwise, although she is meditating, to such a Seetha 
Ravana the nightwalker said these words. [3-55-33b, 34a]


"Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental 
to scriptural canons, oh, empress, what that is approaching you in the form of queen-hood is absolutely 
compatible with the tradition.


"Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental 
to scriptural canons, what that is approaching you in the mode of queen-hood is ordained by gods and 
it is absolutely traditional. [3-55-34b, 35a]


"Let these two feet of yours be massaged by my ten heads, do me favour readily, for I am your subordinate 
and servant. [3-55-35b. 36a]


"I with a lustful hollow-heart spoke all these hollow words that are unbefitting to my stature, indeed, 
Ravana will never supplicate headlong to whosoever woman. [3-55-36b, 36c]


That Decahedral Ravana on speaking thus to Maithili, who is the daughter of Janaka, deemed that 'she 
is mine,' as he has gone under the sway of the Terminator. [3-55-37]

On smashing the mace with arrows Raghava spoke this sentence to Khara smiling him out of temper, without 
assaulting weaponless and flustering Khara, because Rama is the patron of virtue following the protocol 
of righteous war. [3-30-1]


"So, this is all the strength of yours and your army that is displayed and nothing more to display, 
is it! You wretched demon, it is paltriest compared to my strength, yet you vaunt aloud futilely! [3-30-2]


"This mace of yours in which you repose your bombastic aplomb, now completely battered with my arrows 
has gone onto the surface of earth, so also is your vanity. [3-30-3]


"What that is said by you, 'I will dab the tears of the demons whose kinfolk are dead here...' even 
this word of yours is a fake. [3-30-4]


"In boasting you are knavish, in character roguish, and in behaviour ghoulish, such a demon as you are, 
I will take your life away as the Divine Eagle Garuda took away Ambrosia. [3-30-5]


"Now, my arrows will rip and chop off your throat, and then the earth will guzzle the blood gushed therefrom 
garnished with froth and foam. [3-30-6]


"You will go to eternal sleep embracing the earth as you embrace an un-gainable lady, when both of your 
arms are knocked down to slide on earth, and limbs smeared with dirt. [3-30-7]


"While you are in profound sleep, oh, notorious demon, this Dandaka forest becomes a shelter to the 
shelter-worthy sages and saints. [3-30-8]


"When the strongholds of demons in your Janasthaana are ruined with my arrows, the sages in this forest 
will move about everywhere, fearlessly. [3-30-9]


"The demonesses who terrorized others so far will be pitiably terrorised now, and they flee away very 
quickly with tear-wet faces as their kinsmen are killed. [3-30-10]


"To which demonesses your kind of grievous demon is the husband, they must have taken birth in a befittingly 
grievous family like that of yours, and must be well-matched to you in grievous atrocities, and though 
they might not have tasted a grievous situation so far, since their lives have become meaningless, now 
they will become the enjoyers of the empathy of grief. [3-30-11]


"You are atrocious in conduct because you countervail against Veda-s, debased by conscience because 
you counteract to Vedic rituals, and you are countermanding Vedic procedures because you have always 
been bothersome to Brahmans, and those Brahmans becoming sceptical of your deeds of hindrance, they 
are hesitatingly consigning oblations into Ritual-Fire, which are to be swiftly dropped into fire to 
the chants of hymns and even on time, hence you are countervailing against Veda-s and counteracting 
to their rituals, and countermanding their procedures." Thus Rama spoke to Khara irefully. [3-30-12]


While Raghava is speaking that way with such an impetuosity in that forest, Khara started to intimidate 
him rancorously in a voice stridulous than braying. [3-30-13]


"Priding yourself resolutely you are unfearing even in a fearful situation, thereby you have indeed 
gone into the control of death, and for sure you are unmindful of what is speakable and what is not." 
Thus, Khara started his tongue-lashing. [3-30-14]


"Such of those men on whom the Lead of the Time verily closes in, they will not know what is to be done 
and what not, for all of their six senses will be rendered insensible." Thus Khara intimidated Rama. 
[3-30-15]


Saying so to Rama that nightwalker Khara then knitting his brows tightly saw everywhere for an assault 
weapon for use in that combat, and then he indeed found one not far away from him, namely a huge saala 
tree. [3-30-16, 17a]


He curled his lips in frown and started to extricate that Saala tree, and that great-mighty Khara on 
forcefully uprooting that tree with both of hands hurled it aiming at Rama, braying loudly and shouting 
at him 'you are dead...' [3-30-17b, 18]


But that adventurous Rama on shredding that tree which is swooping down with a torrent of arrows, and 
deciding to eliminate that Khara in that war evoked an unusual rancour, which rancour is equally an 
unusual facet of Rama. [3-30-19]


Rama whose body is perspiring and whose eyes are acrimoniously bloodshot at ends, he utterly shredded 
Khara with a thousand arrows in that war. [3-30-20]


Copious frothy blood gushed out from the gashes of arrows on the mountainous body of Khara, like the 
rapids on Mt. Prasavana, and it overflowed on earth too. [3-30-21]


When Khara is tormented with the arrows of Rama in that conflict he is bedevilled and with his blood 
stinking body he quickly bolted towards that Rama alone. [3-30-22]


When Khara is descending on boisterously with his body bathed in blood, that adept one in the Science 
of Archery, <em>dhanur veda</em> , the scripture on archery, and that valorous Rama, 
in swiftness lurched a little...say, two or three steps... [3-30-23]


Then, Rama snatched an arrow which is similar to the Ritual-fire, and secondary only to the ultimate 
missile, namely the Brahma-missile, for the elimination of Khara in war. [3-30-24]


That particular arrow is made available to Rama through Sage Agastya by the king of gods, namely Indra, 
because Indra is a sensible one about the future course of events, and he is also prosperous in securing 
impossible weaponry, and now Rama fitted such an arrow on his bow and released it towards Khara. [3-30-25]


That formidable arrow is promptly released on Rama's stretching the bowstring up to his ear, bending 
bow almost to a circularity, and which arrow is thunderous while in egress like the thunder of a thunderbolt, 
and that has come and plunged inthe chest of Khara. [3-30-26]


Khara fell down on to earth and on being burnt by the radiation of that arrow he is like demon Andhaka, 
who once was very completely burnt by Rudra in Shveta-araNya, the White-forest. [3-30-27]


As with fall of demon Vritta or fall of demon Bala who are eliminated by Indra with his Thunderbolt, 
or as with the collapse of demon Namuchi who is eliminated by the same Indra just with forth or foam, 
Khara too is brought down. [3-30-28]


In this meantime gods gathering along with carana-s drummed celestial drums from all over and showered 
flowers on Rama from all over. [3-30-29, 30a]


And those gods and other celestials in their amazement said among themselves that 'in one and half hours, 
say seventy two minutes of this extreme crack-down Rama with his sharp arrows has eradicated fourteen 
thousand guise changing demons, including their chieftains Khara and Duushana. [3-30-30b, 31]


"Aha! Surprising is this great deed of Rama, the shrewd-soul, what a valour, what a fortitude, really, 
his valour and fortitude are like those of Vishnu..." Thus saying that way all of those gods have gone 
away as the have come. [3-30-32, 33a]


All the kingly-sages and elite-sages along with Sage Agastya, who as incidentally came here to witness 
the victory of Rama, then on foregathering near at Rama delightedly said this on adoring him. [3-30-33b, 
34a]


"He that great-resplendent one, the controller of demon Paka, and the destroyer of enemy's cities, namely 
Indra, once came to the meritorious hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga only for the purpose such an elimination 
of demons. [3-30-34b, 35a]


"For the purpose of eradicating these demons who are the evildoers by nature and the natural enemies 
to saintly people you are led to this countryside by the great sages with an ideation. [3-30-35b, 36a]


"That which is the task of ours it is accomplished by you, oh, son of Dasharatha, now that Dandaka is 
unimpeded these great-sages will be practising their respective sacred devoirs in it." Thus, the sages 
expressed their thanksgiving. [3-30-36b, 37a]


In the meanwhile the brave Lakshmana exiting from the mountain cave came along with Seetha to their 
hermitage, and he is charmed at the victory of his brother Rama. [3-30-37b, 38a]


And then that brave and victories Rama too came towards hermitage while great-sages reverenced him, 
and he entered the hermitage while Lakshmana came forward to greet him. [3-30-38b, 39a]


And Seetha on seeing her husband, the eliminator of enemies and accorder of happiness to sages, embraced 
her husband Rama, rejoicingly. [3-30-39b, 40a]


Janaka's daughter Seetha on seeing the hordes of demons eliminated, and even on observing her husband 
is also scatheless, she is all-smiles for him smiling sniggeringly. [3-30-40]


She whose face is beaming with delight that Seetha, the daughter Janaka, on seeing Rama who has eliminated 
demonic troops, and whom great-sages are worshipping, again embraced him and became rapturous. [3-30-41]

When Ravana is spoken to by Jataayu with judicious words, Ravana's eyes reddened infuriately, and his 
burnished golden ear-knobs flickered injuriously, and that lord of demons dashed towards the lord of 
birds, intolerantly. [3-51-1]


As with two gigantic clouds up-heaved by the tornadic gusts will be hard hitting each other tempestuously 
in sky, the combat between those two, Ravana and Jataayu, became tempestuous in the sky. [3-51-2]


As with a startling combat between two gigantic and winged mountains, called Mt. Maalyavanta-s, that 
combat between the eagle and demon then became a startling one. [3-51-3]


Then the great-mighty Ravana incessantly stormed the lord of eagles Jataayu, with arrows that have excruciating 
and highly dreadful arrowheads, like tubular arrows, iron arrows, and with arrows that have crescentic 
arrowheads. [3-51-4]


That eagle Jataayu who is the lord of winged-chariots, namely birds, in turn sustained those arrays 
of Ravana's arrows in that combat. [3-51-5]


But that great-mighty Jataayu severally made gashes on the body of Ravana with his two feet that have 
gashing claws for that bird is with best stamina. [3-51-6]


Now the Decahedral demon Ravana infuriately took up ten deadly arrows that are similar in their shine 
to the Shafts of the Terminator, wishful of the elimination of his enemy. [3-51-7]


That highly energetic Ravana released and impaled the eagle with straight shooting arrows on fully stretching 
the bowstring up to his ear, whose steel-pointed arrowheads are sharp, hurtful, and deadly. [3-51-8]


That Jataayu on seeing teary-eyed Jaanaki in the chariot of the demon forcefully lunged towards that 
demon heedless of arrows that are lunging at him. [3-51-9]


That unexcelled bird of high refulgence then shattered Ravana's bow which is decorated with pearls and 
gemstones, and on which an arrow is admitted targeting the eagle, just by the pair of his bare feet. 
[3-51-10]&nbsp;


Ravana convulsed in anger then took up another bow and stormed hundreds and thousands of arrow storms. 
[3-51-11]


Nested in the arrows shot by Ravana that lordly bird Jataayu then shone forth in that combat like a 
bird that obtains a readymade nest. [3-51-12]


On winnowing those arrays of arrows with both of his wings, he that highly refulgent Jataayu shattered 
the mighty bow of Ravana with both of his feet. [3-51-13]


That highly resplendent lord of birds also blasted off the armour of Ravana, which is glowing and flamelike 
in its flare, with both of his feet. [3-51-14]


Mighty Jataayu also knocked off the ghost-faced mules yoked to the chariot of Ravana which are covered 
in golden armours and tantivy in fastness. [3-51-15]


Then that great-chariot which is flourishing with three bamboos from chassis to yoke, and which traverses 
just by its steersman's wish, and which is crafted fantastically with gem-studded body and stairs, or, 
whose wheels are crafted with gold and gemstones, and which in its flare is like a Ritual-fire, Jataayu 
splintered down even that chariot of Ravana. [3-51-16]


Jataayu swiftly collapsed the parasol of Ravana which in shine is mirroring the full moon, along with 
the regalia of white-royal-fur-fans, together with the demons handling them for fanning Ravana. [3-51-17]


Again that highly energetic and imposing king of birds pecked off the robust head of the charioteer 
of Ravana with beak. [3-51-18]


Now Ravana who is with his devastated bow, devoid of chariot, dispatched are his horses and departed 
is his charioteer, and such as he is, he on grabbing Vaidehi by her torso, or, placing her on the lower 
end of his torso, jumped to earth. [3-51-19]


On seeing Ravana who is foundered onto earth from his crumbled vehicle, all beings like sylvan deities, 
caarana-s, siddha-s and suchlike, reverenced that lordly eagle Jataayu. [3-51-20]


But on seeing the commandant of birds Jataayu is fatigued owing to his senescence, Ravana is gladdened 
and he again rose up to skies taking Maithili. [3-51-21]


The highly resplendent king of eagles Jataayu swiftly rose to sky dashing practically to forestall Ravana, 
which demon's assault devices are all demolished by now save for a single sword, but who is cheerful 
to spirit away the daughter of Janaka, and actually spiriting away holding her onto his flank, and Jataayu 
spoke this to such Ravana. [3-51-22, 23]


"You mean-minded Ravana, you abduct her whose husband wields arrows that touch off like the Thunderbolt 
of Indra, and this spite of yours is definitely for the destruction of all the demons. [3-51-24]


"As one thirsteth drinketh water, you drinketh venomous drink along with your friends, relatives, ministers, 
armies, and with your accomplices, as this abduction of Seetha itself is squirrelling away dangerous 
poison. [3-51-25]


"As with the mindless adventurers quickly getting ruination for they undertake self-ruinous exploits, 
unknowing the backlashes thereof, so also you too will ruin that quickly with this mindless adventure. 
[3-51-26]


"You are tethered for termination with the lasso of the Terminator, as with a fish that can go nowhere 
on its biting fishhook with a piece of flesh. How do you untether yourself from that lasso of the Terminator, 
even if you go anywhere? [3-51-27]


"But, oh Ravana, the unassailable Raghava-s of Kakutstha dynasty will nevermore condone your assailing 
this hermitage. [3-51-28]


"Like a dastard you are committing a crime of thieving Seetha when none at home in the footsteps of 
thieves, this thieving is contemptible to society and condemnable by valiant ones. [3-51-29]


"Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right 
away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier. 
[3-50-23]


"A person undertakes such an unrighteous and fateful activity if only death looms large on him. You 
too have undertaken this unrighteous fateful activity only for your self-ruination. [3-51-31]


"If sin is consequential to any given activity who will undertake it? Even if that person vies with 
the Self-Born God and Lord of the Universe, namely Brahma, will he undertake it?" Thus Jataayu advised 
Ravana. [3-51-32]


Even on speaking those commonsensical words to Ravana, Jataayu found him carrying off Seetha heedlessly, 
then that valorous Jataayu descended on the hind-side of that Decahedral demon Ravana, devastatingly. 
[3-51-33]


On clasping Ravana with incisive claws Jataayu lacerated deeply and rampantly, as a mahout, an elephant-trainer-controller, 
sitting astride on it will try to control an uncontrollable elephant that is running amok with an incisive 
goad. [3-51-34]


Weaponed only with his claws, wings, and beak, Jataayu not only tore the back of Ravana asunder applying 
his beak and claws, but started to tweeze even his hair. [3-51-35]


His lips becoming intolerantly quivery when Ravana is exasperated by that king of eagles repetitiously, 
that demon staggered on to his right targeting the hovering eagle at his hind-side to fell it down. 
[3-51-36]


Ravana who is aggrieved and convulsed in fury hit back Jataayu with his palm while firmly clutching 
Vaidehi onto his left flank. [3-51-37]


Jataayu, the lord of birds, being a vanquisher of enemies outstripped Ravana and ripped off ten left-arms 
of Ravana with his beak, with which left arms Ravana is clutching Vaidehi, in order to release her from 
his clutches. [3-51-38]


Though his arms are mutilated thus, they instantaneously ricocheted from his body like snakes possessing 
a series of venomous blazes sprawling out from a snake pit. [3-51-39]


The valorous Decahedron Ravana then threw off Seetha, and out of fury he scuffled with the king of eagles 
with fisticuffs and kicks, by both his feet and fists. [3-51-40]


Then there chanced an encounter for some time between those two valorous ones with mutually outweighing 
capabilities, namely the chieftain of demons and the chief of the birds. [3-51-41]


Ravana brandishing his sword at Jataayu, who is revolting for the sake of Rama, hewed off both of his 
wings, sides, and feet. [3-51-42]


When that demon of cruel actions has ruptured his wings that colossal eagle Jataayu immediately fell 
down to earth with a lessened life. [3-51-43]


On seeing Jataayu fallen on earth and dampened with blood Vaidehi fell into a fit of weeping and ran 
towards him as if he is her own relative. [3-51-44]


Ravana, the monarch of Lanka, gazed at that worthily valorous Jataayu, who in his shine is like a blue-black 
cloud with a whitely white chest and who by now is like a quiescent fire-storm flattened onto ground. 
[3-51-45]


But then Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, whose face vies with moonshine hugged eagle Jataayu, whom Ravana 
has subjugated with his forcefulness and felled down onto the surface of earth, and she wept over incessantly. 
[3-51-46]

That prince Rama whom agony and anguish are distressing has become anxious in his mien, and he again 
drifted into a dire desperation while despairing his brother Lakshmana. [3-63-1]


Rama who is sunken in a chasmal sorrow spoke this sentence while wailing sorrowfully, suspiring severely 
and scorchingly, and which sentence is seemly to his sensitivity, to Lakshmana who is already under 
the sway of sorrow. [3-63-2]


"I am second to none among the blameworthy wrongdoers on this earth, thus I deem, and indeed woe followed 
by woe are getting at me in seriation to burst my heart and mind... [3-63-3]


"I might have definitely, habitually, and desirably committed damnable deeds in my previous births, 
and now the result of those impious deeds is very much ripened and has fallen on me, whereby I am entering 
misery after misery... [3-63-4]


"I am deprived of the kingdom, departed from my own people, mainly Seetha, my father departed and I 
am detached from my mother, and Lakshmana, when all these setbacks are very deeply thought over they 
are replenishing the haste of my agony... [3-63-5]


"All this sadness of mine has silenced physically and there is some peace on coming to these desolate 
forests, in association of Seetha, but with the dissociation of Seetha misery is again upshot, as with 
fire which flares up in a flash when fuel is added... [3-63-6]


"My noblewoman might be abducted by a demon, and on reaching the sky that lady who converses with a 
sweet voice might have wept a lot fearfully, and it is definite that she must have shouted a lot, untunefully... 
[3-63-7]


"Those two roundish bosoms of my ladylove which always deserved the application of pleasantly looking 
red-sandalwood's paste might definitely be unshiny, as they might be bedaubed with muddy blood when 
they are extricated from her body for devouring. [3-63-8]


"She has a sweet, softish, and very clear talkativeness on her lips. That visage with such lips is crowned 
with a hairdo with hair lumped together and plaited, such as her visage is, it must have become unshiny 
on her going into the repression of demon, as with an unshiny moon when repressed in the mouth of eclipsing 
planet Raahu, it is definite... [3-63-9]


"The contours of the neck of that strait-laced ladylove of mine are always worthy for necklaces and 
chain-wears. The bloodthirsty demons would have indeed mangled that neck in a secluded place and they 
might have drunk her blood, it is definite... [3-63-10]


"While I was away from her in this uninhibited forest demons would have forcibly hauled her up when 
they are abducting that lady with broad-bright eyes, and she would have discordantly shrieked out like 
a piteous she-dove, it is definite... [3-63-11]


"Sitting very close to me on this stone's surface, oh, Lakshmana, she that well-mannered Seetha with 
bright smiles was speaking to you verbosely with all smiles... [3-63-12]


"Among rivers this Godavari is the best and it is an all the time cherished river to my ladylove, and 
I think she would have gone thereunto. But, at anytime she did not go there, singly... [3-63-13]


"Or, that lotus-faced, lotus-petal eyed Seetha has gone straight to bring lotuses! Nay, that idea itself 
is incongruous, for she never goes to get lotuses, indeed without me... [3-63-14]


"But has she really gone to this stand of thicket which is with flowered trees and with birds of divers 
kind! Nay, that thought also is incongruent, because she as a timid one is much scared of solitude... 
[3-63-15]


"Oh, Sun, you are the knower of performed and unperformed deeds in the world, a wittnesser of good and 
bad deeds in the world, tell me, who am woefully writhing, to where my ladylove strolled, or is she 
stolen... [3-63-16]


"Oh, Air, whatsoever is there in the world, wheresoever it might be, or whensoever it might have happened, 
and whichsoever it might be, and whencesoever it might exist, that cannot possibly be unknown to you. 
Hence, tell me of the lady from noble heritage... is she stolen, or slain, or strayed her steps..." 
Thus Rama begged of the Eternals for locating Seetha. [3-63-17]


To such a Rama whose physique is routed by his anguish in this way and who is insensately bewailing 
in that way, Soumitri whose courage is un-dispirited gave a justifiable and timely suggestion. [3-63-18]


"Oh, noble brother, banish that anguish and brace yourself with fortitude, and let you be with spiritedness 
in her searching... indeed, there is no backsliding for spirited men in their enterprises in this world, 
even though the enterprises are highly impracticable..." [3-63-19]


When Soumitri of towering bravery is speaking this way, Rama, the enhancer of Raghu's lineage, gave 
no heed to it, and since he castaway his fortitude he again encountered an inexplicable anguish. [3-63-20]

On seeing the shattering of his own forces, Duushana bid five thousand mighty-armed nightwalkers of 
monstrous impetus, and who knew no retreat in war, to attack Rama. [3-26-1]


And they with spears, scimitars, swords, and with the rains of boulders, trees and arrows rained incessantly 
and inordinately upon Rama from all over. [3-26-2b, 3a]


Raghava, the virtue-souled, in his turn has neutralised that ghastly and life-taking storm of boulders 
and trees with his fierce arrows. [3-26-3b, 4a]


Like a bull receiving rain with closed eyes Rama assimilated that storming and then evoked an inordinate 
infuriation for eliminating all of the demons. [3-26-4b, 5a]


Exasperation prevailing on him who appeared to be highly blazing with the blaze of his own virtue, he 
then diffused Duushana and his army with arrows from all over. [3-26-5b, 6a]


And on becoming enraged Duushana, the railer of his rivals and the commander of that army, then virtually 
forestalled Raghava's onslaught with his arrows that are simulative of thunderbolts. [3-26-6b, 7a]


That valiant one in warring Rama is then infuriated and with his crescent-barbed arrow shivered the 
sturdy bow of Duushana, shredding four of his horses with four more arrows. [3-26-7b, 8a]


On destructing the horses with excruciating arrows, he even fragmented the head of the charioteer with 
a crescent-barbed arrow, and even impaled the chest of demon Duushana with some more arrows. [3-26-8b, 
9a]


With his bow fractured and chariot shredded, and with horses and charioteer killed, he that Duushana 
grabbed a mace which outranks a peak of mountain and a hair-thriller at its sight, and which girt with 
golden girths once gritted the armies of gods, the head of which is studded with incisive iron spikes 
and saturated with the fat of foes, a coequal of a diamond and a thunderbolt in its hardiness and flashiness, 
and a ransacker of the archways of fortresses of his adversaries. [3-26-9b, 10, 11]


On firmly gripping that mace which in war is akin to an infernal serpent, and the touch of which tantamount 
to snakebite, rushed that nightwalker Duushana with infernal exerts rushed towards Rama. [3-26-12]


While Duushana came falling on, he that Raghava sheared off his shoulders that have wrist-ornaments 
on his arms with two arrows. [3-26-13]


When Duushana's arms are thus sheared in the van of war, his gigantic mace slipped and spun in his own 
front, like the flagstaff with flag raised in honour of Indra, and collapsed . [3-26-14]


With both of his arms strewn around Duushana fell down onto earth like a haughty and gigantic elephant 
when both of its tusks are broken down. [3-26-15]


On seeing Duushana eliminated and fallen to ground, all the beings have applauded Rama saying, 'good, 
good...' [3-26-16]


In the meantime infuriated are the three leading commanders of that army, namely Mahakapaala, Sthulaaksha 
and great mighty Pramaathii, and they collectively ran towards Rama, bound by the rein of death. [3-26-17, 
18a]


Mahakapaala raising a broad trident, Sthulaaksha handling a scimitar, Pramaathi handling an axe rushed 
towards Rama. [3-26-18b, 19a]


As one would receive guests meeting his basic needs, Raghava too took on these untimely guests of war, 
rather the insurgents, meeting their basic needs which now are no more than highly sharpened acute edged 
arrows, when he saw them coming and falling upon him, inopportunely. [3-26-19b, 20a]


Rama, the legatee of Raghu, chopped off the head of Mahakapaala, with incalculable spates of arrows 
he eliminated Pramaathi, and filled the bulging eyes of Sthulaaksha with arrows by which Sthulaaksha 
is killed and fell down onto ground like a burly tree with its broad branches. Then still infuriated 
Rama forthwith eliminated the five thousand hench-demons of Duushana with five thousand arrows, and 
thus he led them to the residence of Time-god, namely the hell. [3-26-20b, 21, 22, 23a]


On hearing about the killing of Duushana and also thus of the followers of Duushana, Khara irately ordered 
his army captains, under whose captaincy mighty forces are there. [3-26-23b, 24a]


"Duushana is killed in war along with his followers, hence all you demons, take formidable army, take 
weapons of diverse designs, combat and kill that evil-human Rama..." Thus Khara ordered the remaining 
demons. [3-26-24b, 25]


Saying so Khara himself rushed towards Rama in rage, and Shyenagaami, Prithugriiva, Yajnashatru, Vihangama 
Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, and Rudhiraaksha 
are the twelve fiendishly atrocious troop leaders of demonic forces, and they too rushed towards Rama 
launching their atrocious arrows. [3-26-26, 27, 28]


He who is resplendent that Rama then annihilated the remaining demons of that army with his arrows that 
are embellished with gold and diamonds, and that are blazing like ritual-fires. [3-26-29]


With those arrows that have golden tailpieces and sharp barbs, and that are dazzling like fuming ritual 
fires Rama felled the demons, as Thunderbolts of Indra will be felling gigantic trees. [3-26-30]


With a hundred rudder like arrows Rama hit down a hundred demons, and with a thousand more, thousand 
more demons are hit in the forefront of that war. [3-26-31]


Ripped are their shields and armorial-ornaments, ruined and rickety are their bows, and they the nightwalkers 
fell flat on ground, bodies wholly smudged with blood. [3-26-32]


With those demons that have fallen down in war, whose hair is tousled and who are drenched in blood, 
entire earth looked like a vast altar of fire overspread with holy grass. [3-26-33]


That forest which became sludgy with the flesh and blood of killed demons and very disgusting, in a 
moment it became identical with hell. [3-26-34]


Thus that Rama, a lone one, that too a foot-soldier, has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of frightening 
exploits. [3-26-35]


Of his entire army great-charioteer Khara and Trishira are the remaining nightwalkers, and Rama, the 
enemy destroyer, naturally on the other side. [3-26-36]


Lakshmana's elder brother Rama eliminated all of the remaining demons in the forefront of war who are 
highly valorous, ghastly and unbearable. [3-26-37]


Then on surveying that great demonic force which is eliminated by Rama in that staggering war, Khara 
then marched on to reach Rama in a huge chariot, as with Indra who will march upraising his Thunderbolt. 
[3-26-38]

On hearing that idea of the chief of demons Ravana in abducting Seetha, Maareecha, a
well-informed one and an articulator spoke to the lord of demons in reply. [3-37-1]


"It will always be easy to get people who talk pleasantly, oh, king, but it is
impossible to get them who talk judgementally and give suggestions that may be apparently insipid,
but that are recuperative, more so, it is impossible to get listeners of such advises. [3-37-2]


"Definitely you do not apperceive Rama who is decidedly dynamic and exaltedly adept,
for you are impetuous and desultory in dealing with your spies, but that Rama is identical to the
thunderous Mahendra and tempestuous Varuna, the Rain-god. [3-37-3]


"Oh, boy, will there be safety to all demons on earth? Or, that highly enraged Rama
will render this world de-demonised! [3-37-4]


"Has this Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, taken birth to end your life, or what! And
because of this Seetha will there be a great disaster, so to speak! [3-37-5]


"Egocentric and rampant, such as you are, on acquiring you as her lord, will the
City of Lanka be doomed along with her demons, and you put together, or what! [3-37-6]


"Any king of your like who is with a self-will, ill-will, ensorcelled by evil, and
malicious in intent, that king alone ruins his own city-state, his own people, even himself, as a
matter of actual fact. [3-37-7]


"Rama the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's happiness is completely forsaken by his
father - no, he is not; there is unseemliness in him - no, not in the least; he is out of character
- no; he is selfish - no; he is an ignoble Kshatriya - no, not at all; and he is neither a debased
one insofar as the merits of righteousness are concerned, nor he is atrocious towards living
beings, for he takes delight in the welfare of all beings. [3-37-8, 9]


"On seeing his father who is a proponent of truth, and whom Kaikeyi has outwitted,
that virtue-souled Rama neatly decamped from Ayodhya saying that 'I will prove my father to be a
real proponent of truth.' [3-37-10]


"Discarding the kingdom and even royal-comforts Rama entered Dandaka forest only to
fulfil the cherish of Kaikeyi, viz., kingdom for her son Bharata, and even that of Dasharatha,
viz., to remain loyal to his promise to Kaikeyi. [3-37-11]


"Rama is ruthless - no; an unscholarly one - no; unconquered are his senses - no;
and oh, boy, it is unapt of you to speak of impalpable and unheard-of topics in this way.
[3-37-12]


"Rama is the embodiment of righteousness, he is an equable person with truthfulness
as his valour, and as with Indra to all gods he is the king of entire world. [3-37-13]


"Rama's proper resplendence is protecting Vaidehi. How then you really wish to
forcibly rob her off from Rama, as though wishing to rob the Sun of his resplendence. [3-37-14]


"Arrows as it jets of fire, bow and sword as it firewood that fire called Rama will
be blazing in war, and it will be inapt of you to enter into such an uninfringeable fire,
recklessly. [3-37-15]


"With the bow stretched to his ear becoming a gaping mouth spouting flames, arrows
becoming tongues of fire spewed forth from that flaming mouth, he that Rama the reified Terminator
will become fierce and insufferable when he wields bow and arrows, and oh, dear boy Ravana, it will
be inapt of you to at once draw pretty nigh of such an annihilator of the armies of enemies, on
discarding your kingdom, comforts and even the dear life of yours. [3-37-16, 17]


"Which Rama's wife is Janaka's daughter that Rama is indeed with an inestimable
resplendence, and it will be incapable of you to steal Seetha while such a Rama's bow safeguards
her in the forest, besides the firewall called his resplendence. [3-37-18]


"That lady Seetha is his wife, dearest than the lives of that lion-chested lion-man
Rama, and in truth, she is avowed to follow him alone, in perpetuity. [3-37-19]


"As the spire of blazing ritual fire cannot be abused, so also, she that curvaceous
Maithili, the cherished wife of that dynamic Rama, is an impossibility for any abuse. [3-37-20]


"Oh, king of demons, What is the result in making such a futile effort? If that Rama
glances at you in a given war that alone ends your life. [3-37-21]


"If you cherish to take pleasure for a long time in your life, in your comforts and
also thus in your kingdom, which kingdom is highly impossible to achieve, do not do anything
unpleasant to Rama. [3-37-22]


"Such as you are, you should firstly deliberate with all of your ministers that have
a righteous bearing, duly keeping your brother Vibheeshana at the helm of affairs, and then you
take a decision on your own considering rights and wrongs of the case, and bearing in mind about
your own strengths and weakness, and even on making sure of Raghava's capability in its reality,
and then it will be apt of you to take up befitting action that will be conducive to your
interests. [3-37-24,25]


"Oh, king of nightwalkers Ravana, I for myself deem that your confrontation with
Rama, the prince of Kosala, in a war is improper, and a better, befitting, and a reasonable one is
this advise of mine, to which you may listen further. [3-37-25]

Maareecha though curtly said in that way, then afraid of the king of night-walkers
he became self-pitying, and said to Ravana, 'let us go.' [3-42-1]


"If he who wields a bow, arrows and a sword, and who brandishes a weapon to only
kill me happens to see me again, deem my life is verily lost, without his shooting any arrow.
[3-42-2]


"None can really make so bold at Rama to reappear with life, isn't it. What is
appearing before you is the reflected image of mine, as I am already slain by the wand of Yama, the
Terminator, the moment I conceded to your demand.


"When you are spiteful, oh, boy, indeed what can I possibly do otherwise, oh,
night-walker, thither I go, may good betide you." So said Maareecha to Ravana. [3-42-4]


By that word of Maareecha demon Ravana is very much gladdened and he spoke this
sentence tightly hugging him. [3-42-5]


"This word of yours shows your obduracy for you are abiding under the control of my
dictate, and though you were a different night-walker earlier, henceforth you are really the good
old Maareecha. [3-42-6]


"Then you promptly emplane this sky-flying chariot which is yoked with ghost-faced
mules and adorned with gems along with me. [3-42-7]


"On deluding Vaidehi it is apt of you to go as you please, and I will bring that
Seetha of Mithila, however defiant it might be." Thus Ravana said to Maareecha. [3-42-8]


Tataka's son Maareecha said "All right" to Ravana, and then both Ravana and
Maareecha mounted the chariot as they would emplane an aircraft and swiftly journeyed from the
surroundings of Maareecha's hermitage. [3-42-9, 10a]


While looking at the seaports and forests, also at all the mountains and rivers,
even at the cities and provinces en route they proceeded. [3-42-10b, 11a]


On reaching Dandaka forest along with Maareecha the king of demons Ravana has then
seen the hermitage of Raghava. [3-42-11b, 12a]


Alighting the chariot that is decorated with golden ornaments Ravana then spoke this
sentence to Maareecha taking his hand into his. [3-42-12b, 13a]


"This one which we are seeing and which is surrounded with banana plants is the
threshold of Rama's hermitage, and -`----oh, friend, the purpose for which we came here let it be
effectuated promptly." Thus Ravana hastened Maareecha. [3-42-13b, 14a]


"And on hearing Ravana's words demon Maareecha then became a deer and indeed ambled
freely in the frontage of Rama's hermitage. [3-42-14b, 15a]


Adopting the form of a gorgeous deer which is superbly amazing just by its
appearance, whose tips of antlers are in the hue of best sapphires, and whose face is whitish at
some places and not so whitish at other in its look, he became a Golden Deer and moved thereabout.
[3-42-15b, 16a]


One of its cheeks in the shade of a reddish-lotus while the other in the hue of a
bluish-lotus, one of its ears is in the hue of bloomed blue-lotus while the other is in the shade
of a sapphire, while the shine of its stomach is like that of a best blue-diamond,
Indra-niila-maNi, and with a little upraised neck that deer has moved about there. [3-42-16b,
17a]


One flank is shining whitish like Madhuka flowers and the other is similar to the
roseate fibrils of lotuses, while its hooves are similar to the gemstone lapis, calves thin, and
thus with very well cohered limbs that deer moved about there. [3-42-17b, 18a]


With an upraised tail that shone forth in a tinge equal to the weapon of Indra,
namely Rainbow, and with a complexion that is lustrous and dappled with many diverse gemlike
dapples, that deer moved thereabout with a heart-stealing aura. [3-42-18b, 19a]


Thus that demon Maareecha emerged like a highly splendorous and fascinating deer in
a wink highly irradiating those woodlands, and the threshold of Rama's hermitage in particular.
[3-42-19b, 20a]


Adopting such an exquisite and heart-stealing form which is amazingly dappled with
the colours of diverse ores, that demon ambled all over there freely with the bearing of a real
deer in order that Vaidehi might be deluded, and he moved forward onto the pastures. [3-42-2b,
21]


And with hundreds of silvery stipples of body he became an astonishing deer with
pleasant looks and indeed moved chewing new grass-blades of trees. [3-42-22]


That Golden Deer has gone into the boscages of banana plants, and moved here and
there around Karnikara trees, and then resorted to a place which is within the eyeshot of Seetha.
[3-42-23]


With an odd lotus like hind-side that astounding deer is verily scintillating, and
it milled around the surroundings in the threshold of Rama's hermitage according to its own
delight. [3-42-24]


That excellent deer beats a retreat and again returns, and meanders thus time and
again, and turns its tail for sometime only to return once again very playfully. [3-42-25]


Again gambolling everywhere it sits somewhere on the ground, then, on coming to the
threshold of hermitage it goes towards herds of deer. [3-42-26]


That demon who has gone into the deer-hood has gone after some herd of deer. But he
returned again though that herd followed him wanting to fraternise, in order that he shall remain
perceptible to Seetha, and he whirligiged in amusing circles while leaping and bounding to and from
that herd of deer. [3-42-27, 28a]


All the other animals moving in that forest on seeing this demon-deer with their
necks up have come close to it, and on smelling it well they are running away to all the ten
directions noticing it as a demon turned into a deer. [3-42-28b, 29a]


Even that demon in the deer's semblance Maareecha, though indulged in killing those
forest animals, and though the other animals are touching him, he is not killing and eating them
indulgently, only for the reason of camouflaging his present nature of demon-hood. [3-42-29b,
30a]


What is more, Vaidehi with her felicitous eyes came towards trees yearning for
plucking the flowers in the same instant. [3-42-30b, 31a]


And she with her inebriating glances and delightful visage moved there about while
plucking flowers of Karnikaara, Ashoka, and of Mango trees. [3-42-31b, 32a]


That select lady who is unmeet for forest life beheld that deer which is completely
gemlike and whose limbs are surprising as though studded with pearls and gems. [3-42-32b, 33a]


And she that Seetha goggled the Golden Deer with a wide-eyed astonishment, which
deer has pretty lips and teeth, hair resembling silver and copper ores, and she indeed gazed at it
with an affinity for wildlife. [3-42-33b, 34a]


On seeing Rama's wife Seetha that highly phantasmal deer too then moved there about
as though to scintillate that woodland. [3-42-34b, 35a]


To see such a deer which is hitherto unseen, and which is as though studded with
numerous gems, the daughter of Janaka, Seetha, went in to an intense wonderment. [3-42-35b, c]

Khara is intimidated on seeing the elimination of Duushana along with Trishira inasmuch as the intrepidity 
of Rama is concerned. [4-28-1]


On seeing the annihilation of the insufferable and mighty force of demons, even that of Duushana and 
Trishira by lone Rama, and thus to apprehend that the demonic force is wholly destructed, that demon 
Khara became apprehensive, and then he lunged at Rama, as with demon Namuchi who once lunged at Indra. 
[4-28-2, 3]


Forcefully drawing the bowstring fitted with iron-arrows, which looked like furious serpents of venom 
ingesting only blood, Khara discharged them on Rama. [4-28-4]


Fidgeting with bowstring in many a way, brandishing missiles with many a skill, Khara moved about the 
battleground in many a manner, seated on chariot and showing his expertise with arrows. [4-28-5]


That great chariot-fighter Khara then started to fill all the stretches and inter-stretches with arrows, 
seeing that even Rama reciprocally started to take aim with his bow Rama, and then filled and made the 
sky less of leeway with verily unendurable arrows that are like tongues of fire emitting sparks, as 
with Rain-god chocking the sky with torrents, less of latitude. [4-28-6, 7]


No empty space is left out in the space around since it has become riotous with the sharp arrows discharged 
by Rama and Khara from everywhere. [4-28-8]


While both of them are warring with excitement to slay one another, then the sun obscured with the mesh 
of arrows has not shined. [4-28-9]


Then with acutely edged tubular, iron, and crescent-edged arrows Khara swatted Rama in that combat, 
as a great elephant will be swatted with a goad. [4-28-10]


When charioted Khara came to the presence of Rama with bow in hand and ready for a close combat, that 
demon appeared to all beings as the Terminator handling his noose. [4-28-11]


Khara presumed that greatly indefatigable Rama is wholly fatigued by now, though he has shown his mettle 
of boldness in eliminating all of the demonic forces, all the while. [4-28-12]


On seeing Khara who is prancing like a lion with a gait of a lion, Rama is unruffled like a lion that 
sees a least beast. [4-28-13]


In a chariot that equals the sun in its radiance then Khara reached Rama as a moth reaches fire. [4-28-14]


Showing sleight of hand Khara then broke the handgrip of the bow of that great-souled Rama along with 
an arrow fitted on it. [4-28-15]


Still infuriated Khara has drawn seven more arrows that equal the radiance of Indra's thunderbolts and 
hit Rama's armour in that war. [4-28-16]


Then, on distressing Rama of unequalled vitality with a thousand arrows in that combat Khara blared 
a loud blare. [4-28-17]


With the arrows released by Khara that have a great egress, then that armour of Rama that has a sun-like 
resplendence is completely destroyed and fell on the field. [4-28-18]


When all his limbs are hit with arrows Rama is enraged and in that war Rama flared up like a fumeless 
flaring fire. [4-28-19]


Then Rama, the blaster of enemies, strung bowstring to another thunderously blasting bow, to end the 
enemy. [4-28-20]


That which is a very admirable bow of Vishnu and that which is awarded by great-sage Agastya, upraising 
that choicest bow Rama rushed towards Khara. [4-28-21]


With arrows that have golden fins and curved barbs that highly infuriated Rama then fragmented Khara's 
flagstaff with flag in that war. [4-28-22]


That eye-pleasing golden flagstaff with flag is severally shattered and fell onto ground as if it is 
god-damned sun fallen on earth. [4-28-23]


By that Khara is enraged, and as one who is aware of striking crucial parts/war tactics assaulted on 
the chest of Rama with four arrows, and even on other limbs, as one would prod an elephant with lancets. 
[4-28-24]


Impacted with various arrows unloosened from the bow of Khara, limbs of Rama are drenched in blood and 
he became highly indignant. [4-28-25]


On aiming his great bow that ablest one among archers, namely Rama, then in that war released six arrows 
targeting pointedly. [4-28-26]


Rama indeed hit Khara's head with one arrow, with two his hands, and next with three crescent shaped 
arrows he hit his chest. [4-28-27]


Then afterwards that great-resplendent Rama wishing to eliminate the demon, infuriately launched 
thirteen iron arrows that are sharply whetted and similar to the dazzle of sun. [4-28-28]


That mighty Raghava who equals Indra in combats, smiling at the warfare of Khara, smashed the yoke of 
the chariot with one arrow; with four, four of the dappled horses; with the sixth, the head of the charioteer 
of Khara; with three, the three-pronged shaft from yoke to the base of chariot; with two the axels, 
thus that chariot is fragmented. Then, on wrecking Khara's bow on which an arrow is placed with the 
twelfth, that mighty one Rama impaled Khara with the thirteenth arrow that is similar to a thunderbolt. 
[4-28-29, 30, 31]


With his bow utterly shattered, chariot fragmented, horses killed, and charioteer felled, that Khara 
then hopped down to ground from the dilapidated chariot wielding a mace, and stood fast. [4-28-32]


The gods as well as great-sages have then came together and assembled in heavens, and those assemblies 
that are aboard their aircrafts are highly gladdened at the exploit of the great chariot-fighter Rama, 
and they worshipped him with their adjoined palms. [4-28-33]

The content of this chapter is to amplify what that has been said in the previous chapter. This dialogue 
between Rama and Lakshmana may be deemed to have happened before their approaching hermitage, as in 
the last few verses of last chapter, and on their pathway to their hermitage.


Rama the descendent of Raghu, again asked Soumitri who strayed from the hermitage and whom his own anguish 
is distressing now, in the middle of path towards their hermitage. [3-59-1]


Rama spoke to such Lakshmana, "when I left her in the forest, I left only on confiding in you. For what 
reason you came to me on abandoning Maithili? [3-59-2]


"What my heart had been doubting, rather a perilous evil, oh, Lakshmana, that has become a fact on seeing 
only you, coming to me leaving off Maithili. [3-59-3]


"Seeing your coming without Seetha on pathway at a distance my left eye and left shoulder have pulsated, 
and oh, Lakshmana, my heart too has fluttered." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [3-59-4]


When Sumitra's son Lakshmana, whose traits are blamelessly auspicious is addressed thus, anguish cast 
a double spell on him, one for the tongue-lashing of Seetha while the other for the reproach from Rama, 
and he replied Rama who is anguished in his own way. [3-59-5]


"I have not come here leaving her off either independently or intentionally, I came here, to your proximity, 
virtually driven by her hurtful words." Thus Lakshmana is relying Rama. [3-59-6]


"Maithili gave an ear to that message which is loudly shouted as if by your honour saying, 'ha, Seetha... 
ha, Lakshmana... save me immediately...' [3-59-7]


"On hearing that grievous voice of yours and owing to her love for you she shuddered with fear and wept 
out to me 'hurry up...get going...' [3-59-8]


"When she frequently and insistingly compelled me to go, I have replied Maithili in this sentence which 
is expressive of my confidence in you. [3-59-9]


" 'I do no think that there is a demon who can cause panic to Rama. All this is feigning. Someone might 
have typified his voice in this way, please control yourself. [3-59-10]


" 'How can my esteemed brother who can safeguard even gods, oh, Seetha, will exclaim in saying, 'save 
me,' which is a highly disparaging and basely manner to call for the help of a lady to safeguard him 
in such circumstances. [3-59-11]


" 'But, somehow, for some reason, someone mimicking my brother's voice discordantly shouted words saying, 
'Lakshmana save me.' [3-59-12]


" 'Oh, auspicious lady, it is unbefitting for you to panic, like lowly womenfolk who will be frivolously 
panicking for flimsy reasons, for the words like 'save me,' shouted by some demon, who may conceivably 
be Maareecha. [3-59-13]


" 'Enough is your slipping into consternation and you be undismayed. There is none in all the three 
worlds who took birth, or going to take birth, to defeat Raghava in any given battle of any terrible 
nature. Raghava is undefeatable even if all gods come battling along with Indra in their van.' This 
is what I said to Vaidehi" Thus Lakshmana is informing Rama. [3-59-14, 15]


"Though I said thus, while her volition is overly besotted for you, Vaidehi said this tartly word to 
me outpouring tears. [3-59-16]


" 'In my respect you have harboured only an impure and nastily perspective to achieve me on the utter 
ruination of your brother, but I am unachievable to you. [3-59-17]


" 'As to why you are refraining to rush towards Rama even though he is inordinately yelling, it hints 
that Bharata made some arrangements with you, and that is the reason why you have closely followed Rama 
in exile. [3-59-18]


" 'You are an adversary of Rama comporting yourself in disguise, following him because of me, and searching 
for a leeway from Rama. Thereby now you are not rushing to Rama. [3-59-19]


"When Vaidehi spoke to me thus I hurriedly came out of hermitage to you with anger reddening my eyes 
and trembling my lips. [3-59-20]


Rama who is deluded by angst said to Soumitri who is speaking thus, that "your arrival without her is 
an improper deed, oh, gentle one. [3-59-21]


"You know that I am capable enough to foil the demons, even then you have come out by the angry words 
of Maithili? [3-59-22]


"On hearing bitter words of an angry lady you have came away on leaving her off, such as you are, I 
am not at all happy with you. [3-59-23]


"That which action of yours is there in non-compliance of my directive to stand guard to Seetha, either 
compelled by Seetha, or coming under your own ire, it shows your dereliction in everyway. [3-59-24]


"By whom I am detoured from hermitage in the form of a deer he is indeed a demon, and he fell flat when 
my arrow hit him down. [3-59-25]


"When I effortlessly shot an arrow setting on bowstring and stretching the bow to full length, he hit 
by that arrow left deer's body to become a piteously bewailing demon wearing bracelets and the like 
ornaments. [3-59-26]


"Then hit down by arrow thus, he with an anguished voice that is clearly audible at a very remotely 
place and that which is mimicking my voice, uttered those highly gruesome words, whereby you have come 
here forsaking Maithili." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana on their way to their hermitage. [3-59-27]

Rama, the great-resplendent scion of Raghu, on instructing his brother Lakshmana in
that way securely fastened his sword with golden handle to his waist. [3-44-1]


Rama whose valour is escalating then took his own insignia, the three-way arched bow
called <font color="#B3003A">kodanDa</font>, and fastened two quivers and proceeded. [3-44-2]


On peering at the peerless one among kings, namely Rama, who is indeed coming down
on him, that Golden Deer disappeared as if with fear and even to beguile him, and again it came
into clear visibility. And Rama speedily spurted to that place from where the Golden Deer has
firstly disappeared with securely grit sword and firmly handled bow. [3-44-3]


Rama the wielder of bow kept on beholding that Golden Deer which is observing him
over and over and running away into deep of the forest. In the next moment he has seen it right in
front of him as though effulgent with its marvellous form. At times he has seen it running away as
though to circumvent the fall of arrow, and at times stopping only to tantalise him. Sometimes it
appeared to be springing as though to skies in very highly perplexity of wariness. It is
disappearing somewhere in the thickets of forest, and it is putting in an appearance elsewhere in
those thickets, like the autumnal orb of the moon under the fly front of splintered clouds.
[3-44-4b, 5, 6, 7a]


In a wink Rama could proximately see that Maareecha who transformed himself into the
Golden Deer, and again in a flash he appeared distantly. Thus that deer/demon has drawn off Raghava
very far from his hermitage in this hide and seek game. [3-44-7b, 8]


Rama of Kakutstha is incensed as its form is spellbinding but its capture slippery,
and then verily tired as he is he stayed on a pasture taking shelter of a tree shade. [3-44-9]


Nightwalker Maareecha has further maddened Rama in the guise of Golden Deer by
reappearing in his close-by, surrounded with other animals of the forest. [3-44-10]


Again on seeing Rama who is stalking his catch that deer ran towards him as though
to impress with its guilelessness, and just at that moment it vanished again as if with extreme
fear. [3-44-11]


Then that deer has again emerged out of the thick of trees, and on spotting it the
great-resplendent Rama has firmed up his decision to fell it. [3-44-12]


At that instant Raghava became highly infuriated and unholstered a holocaustic,
enemy-subjugating arrow that is similar to the flare of the sun, tautening it on his very sturdy
bow that forceful Rama forcefully outstretched the bowstring with arrow targeting the Golden Deer
alone, and released that fierily blazing arrow-missile which is carefully created by Brahma and
which is hissing like a snake. [3-44-13, 14, 15a]


On very profoundly impaling the body of deer's form that superb arrow which is
similar to a thunderbolt has severed the heart of Maareecha in the core of deer's body. [3-44-15b,
16a]


Then Maareecha is highly frenzied as his lifespan is minimised, blared a blaring
shriek, vaulted up to a height of palm-tree, and fell down onto the ground. [3-44-16b, 17a]


Maareecha on his part abandoned the body of Golden Deer when he is dying. But
remembering the words of Ravana that demon gave a thought, 'how best will Seetha hasten Lakshmana
to this place, and how best Ravana can abduct Seetha in a place void of people.' [3-44-17b, 18]


Perceptive of the time that chanced bearing his death, and wishful of the death of
Ravana too, then made a voice that is a soundalike to Raghava's voice and yelled 'ha, Seetha...'
also thus 'ha Lakshmana...' [3-44-19]


When Rama's incomparable arrow has indeed shattered his crucial organ, namely the
heart, in a downright manner, then Maareecha assumed a very massive physique of a demon, abandoning
the form of Golden Deer. [3-44-20, 21a]


On seeing that demon with a fiendish look, who has fallen to earth with limbs
steeped in blood, and who is weltering on the surface of earth, Rama emotionally took flight to
Seetha reminiscing Lakshmana's words. [3-44-21b, 22]


"This is the trickery of Maareecha which Lakshmana vouchsafed earlier, that has
indeed happened in that way alone, and the one whom I have killed now is none other than Maareecha.
[3-44-23]


"This demon died while crying out with a blatant voice 'ha, Seetha... ha,
Lakshmana...' And on hearing this how Seetha will be? And what will be the plight of dextrous
Lakshmana?" Thus on thinking over them that righteous-souled Rama remained in a hair-raising
predicament. [3-44-24]


On killing that demon in the form of Golden Deer, and also on hearing his yelling,
Rama is ensorcelled with a frantic fear caused by his own gloom. [3-44-26]


Raghava then on killing another spotted deer and on taking its flesh, he hurried
himself towards Janasthaana. [3-44-27]

Pleasant <em>hemantha R^itu</em> , pre-winter season has set in after the passage of <em>sharat R^itu</em>, 
post-rainy season at Panchavati where the noble souled Rama is staying comfortably. [4-16-1]


On some day when night faded into dawn Rama started for the delightful River Godavari for a bath. [4-16-2]


His valorous brother Saumitri following him humbly with a handy vessel, along with Seetha, spoke this 
to Rama. [4-16-3]


"Adorned by which season the promising year will be bright, oh, pleasant conversationalist, and which 
season will also be pleasant to you, that hemanta season has set in. [4-16-4]


"These days the dew is harsh to the bodies of people, earth is overlaid with crops, water is unenjoyable, 
but fire is delightful. [4-16-5]


"On appeasing manes with worships during northern solstice and even on performing solstitial rituals 
in time, the righteous people are becoming free from evils. [4-16-6]


"Amply fulfilled are the desires of the villagers with the affluence of milch cows and dairy, and the 
vanquishing kings are make moves for the purposes of their further vanquishes. [4-16-7]


"While the sun is steadfastly attending the direction of Time-god Yama, namely southern horizon, the 
northern direction is not brilliant like a woman who lost the vermilion mark on her forehead. [4-16-8]


"By their very nature Himalayas are the depositories of snow, and presently distanced from the sun they 
are very obviously snowy true to their name. [4-16-9]


"By the way of touch the mid days are comfortable and in these days the daytime is very much comfortable 
for sauntering, thus the sun in daytimes is genial and ungenial are the shades and waters. [4-16-10]


"Overwhelmed by snow presently the noontimes are with soft sun, with bitter cold, with mists and wintry 
breezes, and with them the forests too are bleak in their sheen. [4-16-11]


"Precluded is the reclining under open sky as the nights are led by the Pushya constellation, they will 
now be with brownish-grey fog and chilly, and prolonged are the lengths of nights whereby the three 
watches of night will be quickly slipping away.


"Transgressed is the destiny of moon by the sun as moon lost the chance of keeping people happy with 
his lustrousness in these days, thus the lustreless moon remained in a blushing sphere with fog, just 
like a mirror blinded by the fog of a suspire. [4-16-13]


"Even on a full moon day the moonlight is unbright blemished by mist, and it is appearing like brightly 
Seetha becoming swarthy by sun's heat, but not brightly. [4-16-14]


"The western breeze by itself will be cool to touch, but presently charged with snow it is wafting doubly 
chilly in the early hours. [4-16-15]


"Covered with the dew the forests that already covered with crop fields of barley and wheat are beaming 
forth, together with the callings of waterfowls, at the rise of the sun. [4-16-16]


"The paddy crops in fields are gleaming forth with golden lustre, and their heads full with grain and 
a little bent down are shapely like the flowers of date-fruit. [4-16-17]


"Though he came up long back, and though his beams are spreading around, besieged by snowy mist the 
sun is appearing as moon. [4-16-18]


Inappreciable is the warmth of sun in the mornings, but comfortable for touch at noontimes, since the 
reddish but a little palish sunshine is radiating on earth. [4-16-19]


"The pasturelands are a little moistened with the fall of dewdrops, but the fields of forest are enlivened 
by the radiance of tender sun's warmth. [4-16-20]


"On easily touching very clear and cold water with its very broad trunk that intensely thirsty wild 
elephant is backing away its trunk for the water is that cold. [4-16-21]


"These waterfowls that are sitting nearby are not entering into waters like cowards not entering battlefields. 
[4-16-22]


"Subdued by snowy darkness, enclosed in misty gloom, and reft of flowers these forest ranges appear 
like those that are asleep. [4-16-23]


"Now the rivers are imperceptible as their water is overspread with dewdrops, but their water-birds 
are perceptible only by their callings, thus making that river perceptible, and such rivers are now 
glistening with moist sandbanks and shores. [4-16-24]


"Owing to the fall of snow, further owing to the softness and coldness of sun, the water deep down the 
wells is generally agreeable for drinking. [4-16-25]


"Lotus lakes are left alone with stalks of lotuses as their petals are aged and withered, decrepit are 
the fibrils and carpels, thus impaired by cold they are ungracious in look. [4-16-26]


"But during this time, oh, manly-tiger, ushered by anguish that virtue souled one Bharata must be practising 
ascesis in city with adoration to you. [4-16-27]


"On forsaking kingdom and pride of becoming the king of Ayodhya as well, and varied and various pleasures 
too, he is in self-denial, and with his food regulated he sleeps on chilly surface of earth. [4-16-28]


"Even he might always be getting up at this time of the day and proceeding to River Sarayu for a bath 
surrounded by ministers, definite is that. [4-16-29]


"But how can he who is brought up in high comfort, a delicate one too, enter the cold-wet waters of 
River Sarayu, in these small hours. [4-16-30]


"That lotus-petal eyed one with blue-black complexion is an imposing one with lion-like waist, being 
the noblest he is knower of dharma thus an advocate of truth, and thus intolerant of ignominy, and as 
a self-restrained one he talks dearly and sweetly, and he is dextrous and an enemy-destroyer, such as 
he is, that Bharata on forgoing all of his various pleasures he is devoted to you, as you alone are 
his adorable brother. [4-16-31, 32]


"Even though you are in forests far away from him, he is following you in the practise of austerities, 
and such a brother of yours, that great-souled Bharata has refused ascent to heaven. [4-16-33]


"  Humans do not derive father's attitude but they take of their mothers' is the well-know maxim in 
the world, but Bharata rendered it otherwise. [4-16-34]


"Whose husband is Dasharatha and whose son is gentle Bharata, how then can she, our mother Kaikeyi, 
is with this sort of cruel disposition, indeed " Thus Lakshmana spoke to Rama on their way to River 
Godavari. [4-16-35]


When that upright Lakshmana is speaking those words that way out of his fondness towards Rama, Raghava 
spoke to Lakshmana, intolerant of that slanderous talk about their mother. [4-16-36]


"In any way, dear Lakshmana, you are not supposed to deplore another mother of ours, but you go on telling 
the topics of Bharata, the king of Ikshvaku-s. [4-16-37]


"My mind is indeed set to dwell only in forest, and it is firmly avowed, but while yearning for Bharata's 
fellowship my fascination to reunite with him is recurring again. [4-16-38]


"I reminisce his words well, that are genial, sweet, heartily, ambrosial and that will gladden the heart. 
[4-16-39]


"When can I really reunite, oh, Lakshmana, with great-souled Bharata, valorous Shatrughna, and with 
you and Seetha." Thus said Rama to Lakshmana. [4-16-40]


Thus worrying that way while proceeding, there Rama reached River Godavari and performed bathing with 
his younger brother Lakshmana and along with Seetha. [4-16-41]


Then on offering water oblations to manes and gods that impeccant trinity extolled the rising sun and 
gods likewise. [4-16-42]


On taking bath in the river along with Seetha and Lakshmana, Rama shone forth like All-controlling god 
Rudra, who will be radiant on taking bath along with his consort Paarvati and with his follower Nandi, 
the Holy Bull. [4-16-43]

The portrayal of seasons in epics with all their delicacies is 
a disputed topic. Ramayana also deals much on these descriptions of seasons. Whether an epic avowed 
to reflect the Vedic import, as said at 1-4-6, <em>vedopabR^ihmaNaarthaaya</em> , and that which is 
pious and merited <em>puNyam vedaischa samamatam</em> at 1-1-98, should have accounts on seasons   is 
the question. For this is said that relating niceties of season time and again, is in perfect accord 
with Veda, for the season and time are subservient to all Veda-s as per the ancillary of Veda, the Astrology,
<em>veda-anga : jyotiShya</em> . Veda-s themselves say that the year is the soul of the horse of Ashvameda.
<em>uShaa 
vaa ashvasya medhasya shiraH | sa~Nvatsara aatmaashvasya medhasya | -- yajurveda bR^ihadaaraNyaka</em> 
Hence time and season are the mind and soul of all Veda-s.

Like this we find beautification of four seasons at four places, 
for e.g., <em>hemanta</em> spring is narrated in starting of Kishkindha. And <em>vasanta</em> post autumnal 
season is described in Kishkindha 43rd chapter, when Hanuma and others are in search for Seetha, and 
after their exit from the cave of Swayamprabha. <em>varSa</em> rainy season is portrayed in 28th chapter 
of Kishkindha. At every possible occasion, all the rituals, daily routines that are time oriented, do 
explain the importance of time than the importance of ritual or daily routine. It is said:
<em>vedopabR^ihmaNaartham 
pravR^itte asmin granthe veda vihita karma apekShita kaala visheSha nirNaayakatvaat kaala saadhaaraNa 
lakShaNa pratipaadanam eva tat tat R^itu varNana vyaajena kR^itam iti dharmopayoga sambhavaat | -- saayam 
kaalaadi cihna pratipaadanam iti etat sarvam karma anuShTaana upayukta kaala j~naapanaartham eva kR^itam 
iti dharma paryavasaanam sambhavati eva -- dharmaakuutam</em>

Thus dharma is upheld in 
all these narratives about the season and time, which aspect is upheld by the commentators and they 
too comment lengthily whenever a season or time factor occurs.

After killing that stupendously mighty demon Viradha in forest, then Rama comfortingly embraced Seetha, and spoke to his 
brother Lakshmana who is beaming forth with resplendence. [3-5-1]


"Difficult is this impassable forest, nor we are forest inhabitants either... let's go quickly to that ascetically rich 
sage Sharabhanga..." [3-5-2b, 3a]


On his approach at the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga, a sage with a divine effect and the one with a purified soul, saw 
a great wonder at the nearby of that hermitage of Sharabhanga.[3-5-3b, 4]


Rama has seen Indra, the lord of three worlds, with a radiant body that has the coupled radiance of Sun and Fire, mounted 
on a great chariot that does not touch the earth, wearing greatly brilliant ornaments and attired in spotless dress, while 
the other divinities are attending, and many more selfsame great-souls are worshipping him. [3-5-5, 6, 7a]


Rama saw at his very nearby a chariot yoked with green horses that traverses in firmament, which in its splendour is either 
like the noontime sun, or a cluster of silver clouds, or like the silvern sphere of the moon. [3-5-7b, 8]


He saw the stainless parasol of Indra, marvellously garlanded and shining forth, and the exemplary and invaluable royal 
fanning instruments with golden handles, which two best female celestials are handling and fanning at Indra's head sides 
with them. [3-5-9, 10a]


And the celestials like gandharva-s, amara-s, siddhaa-s and very many great sages as well are extolling Indra who is abiding 
in firmament. [3-5-10b, 11a]


On seeing Indra speaking there to sage Sharabhanga, Rama spoke to Lakshmana. [3-5-11b, 12a]


Rama then on pointing out the chariot expressed his own amazement saying, "Lakshmana see this wonderful chariot that includes 
effulgence and auspiciousness as well, and that abides in firmament, and highly luminous like the Sun... [3-5-12b, 13]


"Of which horses we have earlier heard from our teachers telling that they belong to Indra, the Chief Invitee in Vedic rituals, 
they are these divinely green horses that now abide in the firmament, and definitely these must be Indra's horses... [3-5-14]


"And oh, manly-tiger Lakshmana, those that are there in hundreds and hundreds around Indra, those youthful ones with their 
ear-ornaments and swords in hands, with wide and broad chests, with club shaped arms, and clad in glimmering red garments, 
all are like tigers, all are unapproachable, all of them are wearing ornamental chains on their chest-place that are akin 
to flaring fires, and in their appearance, Soumitri, they always bear a look of twenty-five-year-olds... [3-5-15, 16, 17]


"The age factor of gods remains constant at the age that appears for these nice-looking Tigerly-men, so they say... 
for gods are immortals and they will be ever young... [3-5-18]


"Stay for a moment Lakshmana along with Vaidehi, until I know clearly about that resplendent one on that chariot... [3-5-19]


On saying to Lakshmana stay there only...' Rama proceeded towards the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga.. [3-5-20]


Then, on seeing Rama arriving there, Indra, bade farewell to Sage Sharabhanga and said this to the celestials attending 
him. [3-5-21]


"Here comes that Rama...before he talks to me, you lead him towards his vow, after completing the result of his incarnation, 
then only he is eligible to see me... Let him be a victorious and accomplished one, then I will see him very soon...for 
that will happen very soon... A great deed is to be verily performed by him that is highly impossible for others... [3-5-22, 
23


Then that Enemy-destroyer Indra adoringly bade farewell to the sage, and travelled to heavens by the chariot with its green 
horses. [3-5-24]


On the transit of that Thousand-eyed Indra, Raghava with his adherents [namely Lakshmana and Seetha,] came nearby the 
Sage Sharabhanga, who is sitting nearby the altar of fire. [3-5-25]


Touching the feet of that Sage Sharabhanga Rama along with Seetha and Lakshmana, and duly permitted and invited by that 
Sage Sharabhanga they sat there, as they obtained a shelter. [3-5-26]


Then, Raghava enquired with sage about the arrival of Indra and Sage Sharabhanga narrated all that to him. [3-5-27]


"Oh! Rama, that boon-giver Indra wishes to take me to Brahma's abode, which is achieved by me by my arduous ascesis and 
that which is unattainable for them with their souls unconquered... [3-5-28]


"On knowing that you are course is nearby, oh! Manly-tiger, and without seeing my dear guest I do not wish to go to Brahma's 
abode... [3-5-29]


" Having met with you, a virtuous one and a great soul as you are, oh, manly-tiger, I wish to go through undesirable lesser 
heavens to Brahma's abode, the highest [3-5-30]


"Oh! Tigerly-man, non-diminishing are the abodes achieved by me either in Brahma's abode or yonder than paradise...you take 
them all...that are mine achieved by me ascesis..." So said Sage Sharabhanga to Rama. [3-5-31]


Thus said by the Sage Sharabhanga to that Manly-tiger Rama, being the scholar in all the scriptures he spoke this sentence 
to that sage. [3-5-32]


"I alone can gain all those worlds, oh! Great Saint, I now seek a place to dwell here in this forest as indicated by you... 
[Apparent meaning.] [3-5-33]


"I will however take all those worlds of yours, for you have waited for me and dedicated whatever you achieved by your penance 
at my tri-feet, as <em>atithi satkaara</em>, honouring guests - ' leaving 'the doer and doing' attachment, 
and without desire to enjoy the fruits of works, as a <em>karma phala tyaagi</em> . For now, show me 
a place to dwell in this forest like an ordinary human being - [Implicit meaning according to Govindaraja.]


"I will win-over all those worlds myself, as Kshatriya-s are not supposed to take any donations; they either have to won 
by them or acquire them for themselves, just show me a place to dwell - [Maheshvara Tirtha.]


"Everything merges in me alone, for I alone gave all these to you, and you also dedicated the same in me, without the concept 
of doer and doing - [which again is reiterated in Bhagavad Gita -<em>labhatecha tataH kaamaan mayaiva vihitaan</em> 
|| 7-22 ' All the desires of the adherent like Brahma's abode, immortality etc., are acquired at my grace.' for now show 
me a place to live - [Another concept. tani sloki.]


Thus said by Raghava, who is like Indra in strength, that supremely intellectual Sage Sharabhanga again spoke this sentence 
this way. [3-5-34]


"Here, oh! Rama, a great resplendent sage named Suteekshna, lives in this forest...a virtuous and a self-disciplined one, 
and he will do something benignant to you... [3-5-35]


"You approach Sage Suteekshna and to you he will arrange housing in his auspicious and dpleasant place woods of hermits... 
[3-5-36]


" Following opposite to its flow you may follow this River Mandaakini that carries flower-ferries, then you can reach there 
at Sage Suteekshna's hermitage...] [3-5-37]


"This is the only way, oh, manly-tiger, and oh, sire, see me for a moment, till I forsake these body parts of mine, like 
a snake casting its withered moult... [3-5-38]


Then that hymnist on invoking the sacred fire and offering oblations with clarified butter into it, that radiant sage Sharabhanga 
entered that sacred fire. [3-5-39]


The fire burnt down that great soul Sharabhanga from head-hair to body hair and thus his shrunk skin, bones and whatever 
flesh and blood are there, they are also burnt completely. [3-5-40]


Those who obtained divine knowledge about this mortal body, and those that cannot practice <em>anuSThaana</em> their daily 
chores, or with any incapability, and those that have left house as holder, and desiccated, could give up their mortal bodies 
into fire, waters or falling from mountain peaks.


He that Sage Sharabhanga, then reappeared as an youngster in the semblance of Fire, o\n resurrecting from that altar of 
fire he shone-forth. [3-5-41]


He that Sage Sharabhanga, transcending the ethereal worlds of fire-worshippers, of saints, of great souls, and also of divinities, 
has ascended to Brahma's abode. [3-5-42]


He that meritorious and best Brahman Sharabhanga has seen Brahma in Brahma's abode, and Brahma too, on seeing that Brahman 
happily spoke to him... "Welcome..." [3-5-43]

While Rama is coming towards hermitage his lower eyelid frequently fluttered, his gait faltered, and 
he missed his footing. [3-60-1]


On closely watching those inauspicious forebodings Rama indeed uttered oftentimes reflexly thus as, 
'would she be safe, in fact!' [3-60-2]


He quickened himself and went with an ardency to see Seetha, and then on seeing an empty home his heart 
is distraught. [3-60-3]


Raghava looked like a flying-flutterer as his speed jostled his arms and gait flutteringly, and on closely 
probing there and there, and all-over the places of that cottage, then he saw the lustreless house of 
straw devoid of Seetha, alike a befogged wintry lotus-lake without lustre. [3-60-4, 5]


The trees of that woodland are seemingly weeping, as their flowers are witheringly weakening and their 
birds are weepingly warbling, and the animals are whingeingly weeping, and that woodland is charmless 
and utterly shattered, since its georgic deities have completely abandoned it. Rather utterly bestrewn 
are the deerskins and sacred grass blades, rather utterly battered are the tender-grass-seats and other 
mats in the compound of cottage, and he who ardently wanted to see Seetha, such a Rama, on seeing such 
an emptied locale and cottage, wept over, over and again. [3-60-6, 7]


"That bashful Seetha might be stolen by the grudging demons, or slain by the very same grisly demons, 
or savoured by some gruesome beasts, or else she strayed in this gauntly forest, and even she might 
have playfully shrouded herself in the grimly forest, or else she must be sheltering herself in this 
forest which will be gruelling to locate. [3-60-8]


"Or else, she might have again gone to pick the flowers or fruits, or again gone to lotus-lake, or gone 
to the river for water." Thinking thus, Rama started his search for Seetha. [3-60-9]


Though he searched effortfully for his dear Seetha he did not get her, and as his anguish is reddening 
his eyes the appearance of that glorious one seems to be that of a madman. [3-60-10]


Rama ran speedily from tree to shrub, from hill to hillock, from river to rivulet, and revolving around 
them he wailed for Seetha, as he is inundated in a sludgy ocean of woes. [3-60-11]


"Oh, Kadamba tree, seest thou someone a lady who is lover of Kadamba flowers, one with a lovable face 
and a love of mine, thou tellest me if thou knowest. [3-60-12]


"Oh, Bilva tree, if thou seest someone who is drest in yellowy-ochry silks, whose skin likens to the 
silkiness of thine leaflets, breasts to thine rotund and silky Bilva fruits, thou tellest me... [3-60-13]


"Otherwise, thou Arjuna tree, if thou knowest her who is a lover of thine Arjuna flowers and the ladylove 
of mine, thou telleth whether that slender-waisted daughter of Janaka liveth or otherwise... [3-60-14]


"As to how this Kakubha tree shineth laden with creepy-creepers, foliole-foliage and flowery-flowers, 
this tree knowest Maithili whose thighs can be likened to the smoothish trunk of this very Kakubha tree... 
[3-60-15]


"As to how this best tree among all trees heareth the chorus of honeybees that singest around it, thereby 
this Tilaka tree clearly knowest Maithili, a lover of Tilaka trees, as this shouldst have heard her. 
[3-60-16]


"Oh, Ashoka tree, an alleviator of agony, that is thine name lingually... but practically and readily 
name me after thine, by showing my ladylove, as my agony has marred my empathy... [3-60-17]


"Oh, Palm tree, if thou seest that lady breasted alike ripened-palm fruits of thine, and if thine mercy 
is mine, thou telleth of that shapely lady Seetha... [3-60-18]


"Oh, Rose-apple tree, if thou seest Seetha and thee knowest my ladylove with golden glitter, thou telleth 
me without hesitation...


"Oh, Rose-apple tree, if thou seest Seetha and thou knowest my ladylove whose complexion is smoothish 
like thine Rose-apples, thou telleth me unhesitatingly... [3-60-19]


"Aha! Karnikaara tree, now thou art in full bloom and blooming magnificently, if thou seest that lover 
of Karnikaara-flowers and an immaculate ladylove of mine, thou telleth me... [3-60-20]


Rama has gone on asking trees like mango, niipa, massive saala, jack-fruit, kuruva, dhava, and even 
around daaDima, bakula, punnaaga, sandalwood, ketaka trees, and when he is running around them that 
highly glorious Rama appeared like a madman. [3-60-21, 22]


"Or else, oh, deer, dost thou know what bechanced to that fawn-eyed Maithili, one with quick-looks like 
thee deer? Or else, hast she herded herself into the herd of she-deer of yours... [3-60-23]


"Oh, elephant, thou mightst beheld her whose thighs likens to your trunk at that problematic hour, thus 
methinks, and that Maithili is familiar to thee, and oh, best elephant, if thou beholdest her, thou 
tallest me... [3-60-24]


"Fear not, oh, tiger, hast thou seen Maithili, the moonfaced ladylove of mine, if thou hast seen speak 
in good faith... [3-60-25]


"Oh lotus-eyed lady, in fact I have seen you my dear, then why this running away and concealing yourself 
under trees, why do not you reply me... [3-60-26]


"Stay...stay... oh, best lady, don't you have mercy on me? You are not unacceptably tease-humoured! 
What for you ignore me? [3-60-27]


"Oh, beautifully complexioned lady, even if you are running away your yellowy silk-sari betokens you, 
stay, if you have goodwill for me... [3-60-28]


"Otherwise, she whom I have just seen me may not be Seetha, why because, it is unapt of her to avoid 
me who attained this wretched state, hence Seetha with cheery smiles is certainly murdered... [3-60-29]


"Obviously the raw-flesh gorgers must have gorged that youngish lady on diving all her limbs in my absence 
from my dear one... [3-60-30]


"Her face which is similar to a full-moon with pretty teeth, prettier lips, prettily nose and with prettyish 
earrings, might have obtained a blanched look when being devoured... [3-60-31]


"But that exquisite and beautiful neck of that lady which shines forth in the colour of Campaka flower, 
befitting for any neck ornament, indeed it might be glutted down while she is bewailing... [3-60-32]


"Her two arms which are delicate like tender leaves, ornamented with bangles and bicep-lets might have 
been definitely nibbled while they are wriggling with quivering fingers... [3-60-33]


"This is as though I have forsaken this youngish Seetha really as a feast for the demons in my absence, 
and though Seetha has many relatives she has become as worse as a lonesome woman who is completely forsaken 
by her caravan who is lonesomely ready for the feast of highwaymen, and demons have feasted on her. 
[3-60-34]


"Ha, Lakshmana... oh, dextrous one... have you seen my ladylove anywhere... ha, dear, where have you 
gone... oh, auspicious lady... ha, Seetha..." thus Rama lamented again and again in his search. [3-60-35]


On bewailing in this way and on overly rushing from wood to wood, somewhere Rama has become highly delusional 
by the forcefulness of delusion and spots forest stuff as Seetha, though none of them have any resemblance 
to Seetha, and somewhere else, marking creepers, plants or slender shrubs and suchlike delicacies as 
Seetha he has become really alluded by the powerfulness of allusion, and elsewhere, he is not discriminating 
paths or pathless routes for his trekking as an impassioned one in the search of his ladylove, and thus 
he is nitid like a madman. [3-60-36, 37a]


Rama is on the rove around woods, rivers, hills, mountain-rapids and thicketed forests, speedily and 
restlessly. [3-60-37]


On going round the vast of great forest in that way and on searching for Maithili, his hope became intangible, 
but again he undertook the search for his ladylove, over-strenuously. [3-60-38]

Raghava's younger brother Lakshmana is very much infuriated at Seetha who spoke to him rudely, as such 
he journeyed towards Rama at once as though he is yearning to see Rama immediately, albeit his heart 
wanted him to stand guard to Seetha. [3-46-1]


Quickly taking hold of intervallic time then the ten-headed Ravana approached Vaidehi adopting an aspect 
of a sanyaasi, a meandering Brahman friar. [3-46-2]


That sanyaasi is now cloaked in smooth silky saffron, his head-hair is neatly tufted, sandals are wooden, 
umbrella is on right shoulder, and on his left shoulder a shaft of sanyaasi is shouldered, onto which 
his handy water vessel is hooked, and he proceeded towards Vaidehi in a mien of meandering sanyaasi. 
[3-46-3, 4a]


As with a pitchiest gloom overcoming the sunless and moonless lively eventide, that great-mighty Ravana 
came over to Vaidehi in that forest, when she is without two of the brothers, namely Rama and Lakshmana. 
[3-46-4b, 5a]


As a sinister planet looks over Star Rohini when she is devoid of Moon, that extremely sinister Ravana 
then looked over the glorious and youthful princess Seetha. [3-46-5b, 6a]


On observing ferocious Ravana whose activities are iniquitous, the trees of Janasthaana are not in full 
sway, nor the wind is in full swing. [3-46-6b, 7a]


On seeing him who is seeing with his bloodshot eyes, River Godavari too is frightened and started to 
rush off quietly, whose onrush will be rapid otherwise. [3-46-7b, 8a]


In the meanwhile the Decahedron demon Ravana, who is all the while waiting for some lapse of Rama, neared 
Vaidehi in the getup of a sanyaasi. [3-46-8b, 9a]


That disgraceful Ravana made advances in a graceful mien of Brahman almsman to Vaidehi who is thinking 
over her husband, like the slow moving Saturn making advance to Star Citra which will be ominous. [3-46-9b, 
10a]


Like a wellspring shrouded by grass, enshrouded in a decent getup of a Brahman friar, in a trice Ravana 
leeringly stood before of Vaidehi, the admirable wife of Rama. [3-46-10b, 11a]


While standing before her then Ravana eyed at the auspicious wife of Rama, whose lips and teeth are 
fine, visage is shiny like a full moon, and who is presently tortured by her tearful lamentation and 
sitting in the straw-cottage, and he approached that lotus-petal eyed Vaidehi who is dressed in ochry 
silks, as that night-walker is gladdened at his heart for her solitude. [3-46-11b, 12,13]


He who is hit by the arrows of Love-god that king of demons Ravana, on seeing Seetha entered resonating 
the resonances of Vedic-hymns as precursory in seeking alms, and spoke these well-mannered sentences 
to her who is in solitariness. [3-46-14]


Ravana really acclaimed her who is an excellent one in all the three worlds, beaming forth with the 
beauty of her body, and who is like Goddess Lakshmi but for Divine-lotus as Her settle, for Seetha is 
devoid of her settling, namely Rama. [3-46-15]


"Glittering like the glitter of gold, silkened in ochry silks, you are like a lotus-tendril garlanded 
with divine lotuses as your ensemble, who are you?" Thus Ravanan started addressing Seetha [3-46-16]


"Oh, rosy faced one, are you the personified numen of Respect, Renown or Resplendence, or the Felicitous 
Lakshmi herself, or oh, curvaceous one, are you a nymphal Apsara, or the numen of Benefactress, or a 
self-motivated woman, or Rati Devi, the consort of Manmatha, the Love God. [3-46-17]


"Your teeth are evenly, smooth and their tips are like jasmine buds, and your whitish broad eyes are 
spotless, reddish at ends, and pupils are black. [3-46-18]


"Your hips are beamy, thighs burly akin to elephant's trunks, and these two breasts of yours that are 
ornamented with best jewellery are rotund, rubbing and bumping each other, and they are swinging up 
and up, their nipples are brawny and jutting out, and they are smoothish like palm-fruits, thus they 
are covetable for they are beautiful. [3-46-19, 20]


"Oh, allurer, your smile is alluring, teeth are alluring, and your eyes allure, oh, beauty, your waist 
is palmful, your hair velvety, your breasts are jostling, and you rob my soul as a spate robs riverbank. 
[3-46-21, 22a]


"I have not hitherto seen any earthly female with this kind of features on the face of earth; or, a 
goddess - no; a gandharva female - no; yaksha female - no; kinnaraa female - no, none whosoever! [3-46-22b, 
23a]


"I marvel why an excellent one in all the three worlds by her features, more so, fragile and youthful 
as yourself should be living here in the thick of forest. [3-46-23b, 24, 25a]


Such as you are you go back, let safety betide you, as you are unsuited to live in here, for this forest 
is the dwelling for ghastly demons who by their wish will be changing their guise. [3-46-24b, 25a]


"Delightful rooftops of skyscrapers, flourishing and richly fragranced pleasure-gardens of cities alone 
are meetly to you to saunter. [3-46-25b, 26a]


Oh, beauteous lady, I opine that only best garlands, best scents, best foodstuffs, best clothing are 
meetly to you, oh, lady with black pupils, hence it is meet and right to you to have a best husband.


"Getting at you, the garlands, scents, foodstuffs, or clothing, they all become the best, because you 
are the best beauteous one, as such, he alone becomes a best person who gets you as his wife, and it 
is meet and right to you to choose such a husband, [aside: me alone.] [3-46-26b, 27a]


"Oh, curvaceous lady, who are you? Oh, one with an impeccable smile, do you belong to Rudraa-gods, or 
Marut-gods, or to Vasu-s? To me you are beaming forth like a goddess. [3-46-27b, 28a]


"This is the dwelling-place of demons, and no goddess, nor a gandharva, nor a kinnara can arrive here, 
but how you have come here? [3-46-28b, 29a]


"Here, simians, lions, leopards, tigers, likewise other predators, bears, tigers, vultures will be moving. 
How you are not frightened from them? [3-46-29b, 30a]


"Being alone in this forest, oh, lady with a lovely face, how you are unafraid of horrendous and mighty 
elephants possessed of rut? [3-46-30b, 31a]


"Oh, auspicious lady, who are you? Whose are you? Also from where are you? And being lonely, what for 
you are moving in dreadful Dandaka forest that is adored by demons?" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-46-31, 
32b]


When the wicked minded Ravana praised her in this way, Vaidehi the princess from Mithila has seen him 
who has arrived in the getup of Brahman and started to revere him with all the respects affordable to 
a casual guest. [3-46-32b, 33]


She firstly fetched a seat him, then invited him with water for feet-wash, and then said to him who 
looked gracious in his bearing, 'alms are ready.' [3-46-34]


Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, 
and finding no reason to refute him flatly, as he has come like a Brahman, she invited him as a Brahman.


Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, 
and as he came with an unimperilling appearance of a Brahman, she invited him as she would 
ordinarily invite a real Brahman. [3-46-35]


"Oh, Brahman, this is the Darbha-grass-seat and you be seated comfortably, here is water, receive it 
for hand and feet wash, here is the forest grown victuals for your sake... dine on them relaxedly..." 
Thus Seetha said to Ravana. [3-46-36]


Ravana thoroughly observed that wife of the king, Maithili, when she invited him talking civilities 
contextual in inviting a guest, that too Brahman sanyasi, and he firmed up his mind to abduct her even 
forcibly, and started to dedicate himself for destruction. [3-46-37]


Then she looked forward for her shapely husband who has gone on a hunting game, and who must be returning 
along with Lakshmana, and though she looked intently she could only see the green backdrop of that great 
forest, but not Rama or Lakshmana. [3-46-38]

Rama on seeing that eagle felled to ground by the atrocious Ravana, said this sentence to Soumitri who 
is an asset for good companionability. [3-68-1]


"While this bird is venturing in my concern the demon felled him in combat and he is leaving off his 
lives owing to me, definitely... [3-68-2]


"Obviously, lives in his body are very feeble, oh, Lakshmana, it is natural, isn't it, and he looks 
highly anguished with a dulled voice..." Thus on saying to Lakshmana, Rama then spoke to Jataayu. [3-68-3]


"Oh, Jataayu, if you are in fine fettle to further reiterate words, relate about Seetha, let safe betide 
you, and recount how you are murdered, too... [3-68-4]


"What is the reason for Ravana in stealing that noblewoman, and even what is the wrong I have committed 
in his respect, keeping which in view that Ravana stole my ladylove... [3-68-5]


"How was that moon similar heart-stealing face of hers at that time of abduction, oh, best bird, and 
even what are the words she uttered when being abducted... [3-68-6]


"What is his stamina of that demon? What is his form? And what are his strategies? And where is his 
stronghold? Oh, sire, tell me while I ask you inquisitively..." Rama urged Jataayu thus for information. 
[3-68-7]


Then that warm-hearted Jataayu with his eyes rolling upwards saw Rama and with a fluttery voice said 
this sentence to Rama who is wailing like an orphan. [3-68-8]


"Resorting to his illusionistic devices like creating an immense and tumultuous windstorm and cloud-cover, 
the flagitious chief of demons Ravana abducted Seetha... [3-68-9]


"That night walker hacked both my wings when I was overtired, and went southward taking the princess 
of Videha, Seetha, along with him... [3-68-10]


"My sight is spinning and my lives are stifled, oh, Raghava, I am now seeing golden trees with cuscus 
grass as their treetops... [3-68-11]


"In which spell of time Ravana has gone taking away Seetha, that spell is named as Vinda... if any riches 
are lost during that spell, the original possessor of those riches will repossess them very quickly... 
oh, Kakutstha, he that Ravana is unmindful of that fact and stole Seetha only to loose her... [3-68-12, 
13a]


"On stealing your ladylove Janaki, that chief of demons, Ravana, will ruin himself, as with a fish which 
swallows a baited fishhook... [3-68-13b, c]


"Impractical is your anguishing for the daughter of Janaka, as you will delight yourself with Vaidehi 
in no time, on killing that Ravana in the vanguard of a war..." Thus saying Jataayu paused for a while. 
[3-68-14]


Though Jataayu is speaking on to Rama with an alert mind, blood freely flowed from his mouth with shreds 
of flesh as death verged on him, even then he struggled to say. [3-68-15]


"That demon is the son of Vishravasa... literally... the brother of Kubera..." on saying thus, that 
lord of birds released his lives, which are unobtainable for oneself. [3-68-16]


But the lives of Jataayu departing from his body went into thin air before the very eyes of Rama who 
is still speaking to him with folded-palms, "tell... tell more..." [3-68-17]


Jataayu flopped his head on earth, sprawled his feet on ground, and then his body collapsed onto the 
surface of earth writhing jerkily. [3-68-18]


He who is worsened by very many mishaps that Rama, on seeing the mountainous eagle whose eyes are bloodshot 
and whose lives have gone, said this way to Soumitri... [3-68-19]


"This bird which for years together lived fearlessly in Dandaka forest, a habitat of demons, that bird 
wilted to death, because of me... [3-68-20]


"He who has longevity over many years, who actively strived for a long for rectitude, he is now killed 
and prostrating before the Time, because of me... alas... it is indeed impossible to infringe the Time... 
[3-68-21]


"Lakshmana, this eagle which has dashed to rescue Seetha in order to render help to me is slain by that 
brute-forced Ravana, only because of me, you see... [3-68-22]


"On abandoning great empire of eagles belonging to his father and forefathers this lord of bird has 
now abandoned his lives too, only for my sake... [3-68-23]


"Universally noticeable are the protective, prepotent, principled ones that are the followers of probity, 
oh, Soumitri, even though their births are avian or bestial... [3-68-24]


"To me, oh, enemy-inflamer, oh, gentle Lakshmana, anguish caused by Seetha's abduction is not that much, 
when compared with the anguish caused by the perish of this eagle, that too, because of me... [3-68-25]


"As to how the celebrated and highly renowned king Dasharatha is venerable and honourable for me, likewise 
this lord of birds is also a venerable and honourable one to me... [3-68-26]


"Oh, Soumitri, get the firewood and I will produce fire by friction of two sticks, as I wish to cremate 
this lord of birds who expired because of me... [3-68-27]


"Oh, Soumitri, I will mount this lord of realm of birds onto the pyre and cremate him who is killed 
by a feral demon..." Thus saying to Lakshmana, Rama said this to dead eagle Jataayu. [3-68-28]


"Oh, greatly mighty king of eagles, by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to, you depart 
to the unexcelled heavenly worlds... you depart to those worlds that are destined for the virtuosos 
of Vedic-rituals, and to those worlds that are destined for the practisers of ascesis amid Five-Ritual-fires, 
and to those that are destined for un-retreating combatants, and to those worlds that destined for the 
donors of lands..." So said Rama to the departed Jataayu. [3-68-29, 30]


On saying that way, that ethical-souled Rama mounted that lord of birds onto the pyre and he sorrowfully 
incinerated that eagle in a flaring fire of pyre, as he would do in respect of his own deceased relative. 
[3-68-31]


Then that resolute Rama on going into forest along with Soumitri hunted a robust-bodied, big Rohi animal, 
or, Kesari animal, and then he spread sacred grass on ground to place that offering to the deceased 
soul of that bird. [3-68-32]


On drawing up the flesh of that Rohi animal and lumping it to gobbets, that highly observant Rama placed 
those gobbets on pleasant greenish pasturelands as obsequial offerings in respect of that bird Jataayu. 
[3-68-33]


Rama immediately chanted Vedic hymns that are employed in such funerals of one's own paternal people, 
as Brahmans say that those hymns are employable in such rites as they lead the soul of the departed 
to heaven. [3-68-34]


Then both the sons of that notable man, namely Dasharatha, on going to River Godavari they have oblated 
waters for that king of eagles, Jataayu. [3-68-35]


Both of the Raghava-s took funeral baths in the waters of River Godavari and then made water oblations 
to the king of eagles. [3-68-36]


That king of eagle Jataayu, who has performed a creditworthy deed of stalling and combating Ravana, 
but who is felled by that Ravana, went away to the merited and auspicious heavenly realms of his own, 
as and when consecrated by sublime sage like Rama. [3-68-37]


Even those two, Rama and Lakshmana, on performing water oblations in respect of that best bird Jataayu, 
and on assertively giving thought to the information given by Jataayu, they like the chiefs of gods, 
namely Vishnu and Indra, went to southerly woods when their mind is set to search for Seetha. [3-68-38]

This is a much debated chapter in Ramayana because human complexities are involved in its narration. 
The sublimity of Seetha's characterisation is disputed by her speeches in here. The question is whether 
Seetha becomes an ideal woman in view of her tongue-lashing, or not. This is as good as asking the nature 
as to 'why it thunders before a storm, scaring children, birds and calves... cannot it just shower some 
rains and go...' If anything is not done in accordance with her wish and whim, or which goes against 
her peculiar way of thinking, it is usual for a shrewd woman to tongue-lash. Here, Seetha is called 
a woman who is <em>bhartR^i prema antha - bhartR^i kShema arthi</em> 'blinded by the devotement to her 
husband...' 'a desirer of her husband's welfare...' even at her own risk.


This Ramayana is not the story of Rama. It is <em>raama ayana</em> and becomes <em>raamaayaNa</em> when 
compounded. Again <em>raama</em> is not the epical hero Rama alone. Seetha is also <em>raamaa</em> as 
said by Sumantra in Ayodhya, Ch. 60, 10th verse:


Thus this epic is called <em>raamaa raamayoH ayanam raamaayaNam</em> 'the peregrination of Seetha and 
Rama...' where the first word <em>raamaa</em> with elongated end syllable belongs to Seetha and the 
second <em>raama</em> with shortened end syllable belongs to Rama, and thus this is the peregrination 
of both Raamaa and Raama. If the course of the legend has to move forward, the characters have to move, 
and if they were to move, some situations should become turning points, and this is one such situation 
occasioned through the shrewdness of Seetha. In a legendary perspective, if evil is to be eliminated, 
good has to peregrinate troublesomely, and that troublesome peregrination of Seetha, as well as that 
of Rama, is triggered off at this situation, again due to the shrewdness of Seetha. Thus, there is no 
oddity in the shrewd talk of Seetha. Some more discussion is incorporated in the endnote.


On identifying the grievous voice that is identifiable with her husband's voice, Seetha spoke to Lakshmana, 
"you go at once, and check up on Raghava.' [3-45-1]


"I have heard the loud yelling voice of highly fretful Rama whereby my heart, or my very entity, is 
not abiding in its place, and it will be apt of you to protect such a brother of yours who is screaming 
in the forest. [3-45-2, 3a]


"He might have come under the subjugation of demons as with a bull coming under the seize of lions, 
hence, you hurry up so as to near such a brother of yours who is seeking protection." So said Seetha 
toi Lakshmana. [3-45-3b, 4a]


Although she spoke a lot to him in this way, Lakshmana on his part has not moved out remembering his 
brother's order to stay guard to Seetha, and hence that Janaki, the daughter of Janaka, who is already 
agitated for Rama further spoke to him in the paradox of his not going out of hermitage. [3-45-4b, 5a]


"You are like a foe of your brother in friend's mien, Soumitri, as you are not making a move towards 
a brother even if he is in an emergency. [3-45-5b, 6a]


"Because of me you wish Rama to be completely destroyed, and only because of your cupidity for me you 
are not following up on Raghava. It is definite. [3-45-6b, 7a]


" 'Raghava in direst strait' is the most liked thing to you, thus I deem, as you have no heart for that 
brother, and as you complacently stay behind even when that great-resplendent Rama is unseen. [3-45-7b, 
8a]


"After which helmsman you have come here that Rama is undergoing an uncertainty of life-and-death, as 
such I indeed wonder what business you have here now in staying with me at this hermitage?" Seetha spoke 
so to Lakshmana. [3-45-8, 9a]


Lakshmana spoke to Seetha, the princess from Videha kingdom, who is talking deluged under tears and 
anguish in that way, as she is fretful like a she-deer. [3-45-9a, 10b]


"Oh, Vaidehi, your husband is an impossible one for vincibility by serpents, asura-s, gandharva-s, gods, 
fiends, demons, no doubt about it.


"Oh, auspicious one, unmarked is some combatant who can counterattack Rama from among gods, humans, 
gandharva-s, birds, ogres, kinnaraa-s, beasts, or oh, lady, even from horrendous demons, as Rama vies 
with Indra in any given war. [3-45-11b, 12, 13a]


"It is inapt of you to talk that way as Rama is inextirpable in a given war, and as for me, I do not 
venture to abandon you in this forest in the absence of Raghava. [3-45-13b, 14a]


"Let the most forceful Crowns with all their military forces, or, all of the gods together with their 
heads, why they, let all the three worlds put together come mutinously, whether jointly or severally, 
Rama's prowess is irrestrainable. [3-45, 14b, 15a]


"Hence, let your heart be diverted and anxiety divested, as your husband will be returning soon on killing 
that extraordinary deer. [3-45-15b, 16a]


"Evidently it is not the voice of Rama, nor that of any other god, but someone mimicked that voice for 
chicanery, and that must be the illusory voice of that demon Maareecha, similar in effect to the magical 
city of gandharva-s usually created by magicians in general. [3-45-15b, 16]


"And you are an entrustment, oh, best lady Vaidehi, as the great-souled Rama has entrusted you in my 
security, as such I do not dare to leave you off now. [3-45-17, 18a]


"Oh, gracious lady, we have become the adversaries of these night-walkers insofar as the elimination 
of Khara and others, and concerning the eradication of Janasthaana. [3-45-18b, 19a]


"The demons are the swaggerers in violence in great forests and they will be employing various voices. 
Therefore Vaidehi, just do not bother about it." Thus Lakshmana advised Seetha. [3-45-18b, 19, 20a]


As for Seetha, she became furious on hearing Lakshmana's words of advice, and while her eyes are becoming 
bloodshot she spoke these rude sentences to that veracious Lakshmana. [3-45-20b, 21a]


"You are a debased one devoid of mercy, thus a dreadful one, and a degrader of your dynasty, and I deem 
that you derive pleasure from fatal hardship to Rama. [3-45-21b, 22a]


"You are haranguing all these sermons only on noticing hardship to Rama. It is unsurprising that the 
pitiless ones and rivals of your kind, who always behave in a cloak-and dagger way, will tend to commit 
deadly sins, Lakshmana, and it is not uncommon. [3-45-22b, 23]


"You are verily maleficent for you have singly and covertly followed Rama, who started to forests all 
alone, or instigated by Bharata, only because of me. [3-45-24]


"Whether this is an intrigue of yours or that of Bharata it is unachievable, Saumitri. How can I long 
for another commoner when I have put my faith only in the lotus-blue-complexioned and lotus-bright-eyed 
husband of mine, Rama? [3-45-25, 26a]


"If that comes to that, I will just discard my life in your presence, Soumitri do not mistake it. I 
do not eke out an existence on this earth even for a moment without Rama." Thus Seetha threatened Lakshmana. 
[3-45-26b, 27a]


When that self-mortified Lakshmana is addressed in this way with hair-raising and acerbic words by Seetha, 
he spoke to her suppliantly adjoining his palm-fold. [3-45-27b, 28a]


"I do not venture to reply you Maithili, as you are like a deity to me. Women using words that are in 
a class by themselves is not at all surprising. This sort of bringing stilted words into play is the 
nature of women and it is obvious in the world. [3-45-28b, 29]


"Women by their nature are unbound by the etiquette of decency, whimsical, cantankerous and they tend 
to become the artificers of vicissitudes, and oh, Vaidehi, the daughter of Janaka, indeed unbearable 
are this kind of words that are much the same as burnt iron arrows thrust in between my two ears. [3-45-30, 
31a]


"Let all of the forest-itinerants indeed listen as to how you are addressing me with bitter words, though 
I am reasoning with you conscientiously, and let them become my corroborators for the sake of justice. 
[3-45-31b, 32a]


"Fie upon you, you are acrimoniously tempered owing to your faminality, and by which impulsive reason 
you mistrust me who am presently abiding in my brother's order, may God damn you for that crotchety. 
[3-45-32b, 33a]


"I am going there where Rama is, oh, lady with best visage, you be blest, and oh, broad-eyed one, let 
all of the forest deities protect you. [3-45-33b, 34a]


"Gauging by those dangerous forebodings that are now bidding fair, can I to see you again along with 
Rama on my return, or not? That I do not know." Thus Lakshmana spoke to Seetha. [3-45-34b, c]


When Lakshmana spoke to that wailful daughter of Janaka, she on her part spoke this curt sentence to 
him, while tears whelmed her to a fault. [3-45-35]


"Without Rama I plunge myself in River Godavari, or else I string up myself, or discard this body of 
mine from heights..." Thus Seetha started to vent out her feelings. [3-45-36]


"I drink deadly poison, or I enter a flaring fire, but I will never touch another man other than Raghava. 
[3-45-37]


Seetha on declaring to Lakshmana in this way, she who is anguished and weeping bitterly, then started 
to smite her belly with both of her palms in a heightened agony. [3-45-38]


Observing the agonised aspect of Seetha that cheerless Saumitri started to cheer her up by repeatedly 
informing that her husband Rama will come soon. Even then Seetha has not spoken in the least to the 
brother of her husband, and maintained a silence of antipathy. [3-45-39]


But then, holding Seetha in usual reverence that self-respectful Lakshmana briefly came to her fore 
making a reverential palm-fold that briefly, and then he proceeded to the proximity of Rama, while repeatedly 
looking back at that lonely lady in the thick of forest. [3-45-40]

On hearing Seetha's words that valorous ten-headed Ravana loudly clapped in dissent for once and divulged 
his very mighty body. [3-49-1]


That wordsmith Ravana again spoke these words to Maithili, "Perhaps you have not heard about my valour 
and vanquishes in all your madness for Rama. [3-49-2]


"Standing on the sky I can lift up the earth with two of my arms, I can completely gulp down any ocean, 
standing in war I can even put the Death to death. [3-49-3]


"Indeed, I can split the Sun and splinter the earth with my splitting arrows, oh, mad woman, I can assume 
any form as I wish, and endow any wish you wish, such as I am, I must be your husband, behold me." So 
said Ravana when revealing his real nature. [3-49-4]


While the infuriated Ravana is saying in that way his eyes which by themselves are torchlit in their 
shine have became further bloodshot and blackened at their edges. [3-49-5]


Immediately discarding the gentle form of a Brahman friar, that younger brother of Kubera, Ravana, assumed 
his own ferocious form which is similar to the form of Terminator. [3-49-6]


That celebrated Ravana whose eyes are bloodshot as he is ensorcelled by desperate fury transmuted his 
form into a tend-faced, twenty-armed night-walker wearing golden ornaments of purified gold and appearing 
as a black tempestuous cloud. [3-49-7, 8a]


On discarding that guise of a Brahman friar that sovereign of demons Ravana educed his own physique 
and then that mighty bodied one attired in reddish clothing stood before Maithili observing that gem 
of a lady. [3-49-8b, 9]


She whose tresses are glossily blackish until their ends, and who has on her glittering jewellery and 
silken-ochry-sari, whereby who is imperceivable like sun's glaring shine, to such Maithili Ravana spoke. 
[3-49-10]


"If you wish to have a husband of well-renown in three worlds you seek shelter in me, oh, high-hipped 
lady, I alone will match up to you as husband. [3-49-11]


"Ultimately you have a much-lauded husband in me, as such you oblige me, and I will not cause any displeasure 
to you at any point of time. Let your heart refrain from that humanly Rama and you start bringing round 
your heart towards me. [3-49-12, 13a]


"Oh, halfwitted lady, you who deem yourself a highly intellectual lady, listen, that mindless Rama who 
just by a word of a woman forebode kingdom along with all of his amiable people, and lives in this forest 
where the predators are on the prowl, thus he who is spurned off from kingdom, ungainful are his purposes, 
and who is even a short-lived human, I wonder by what merits you are impassioned for such a Rama?" Thus 
Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-49-13b, 14, 15a]


On saying that sentence to Maithili, who by herself is a nice talker and who is a proper one for addressing 
with nice words, that verily evil-minded demon Ravana maddened by lust drew nigh of Seetha and grabbed 
her, as Budha, the Jupiter grabs the Star Rohini in firmament. [3-49-15b, 16]


He that Ravana grabbed the lotus-eyed Seetha on lifting her up with his left hand at her plait of hair 
at nape, and with his right hand at her thighs. [3-49-17]


On seeing him who grabbed Seetha, who has incisive fangs, mightily armed and who is shining forth like 
a mountain crest and similar to Death, the forest deities quickly fled away terrorised by his terrorism. 
[3-49-18]


Then the miracle-air-chariot of Ravana which is miraculously designed to appear and disappear at the 
wish of its master, yoked with miraculous mules, and built with its golden wheels and parts, appeared 
afore Ravana braying noisily. [3-49-19]


Then he whose voice is strident that Ravana lifted her up by her waist and got Vaidehi up on the air-chariot 
intimidating her with bitter words. [3-49-20]


Agonised with anguish when gone into the captivity of Ravana, she that glorious Seetha wailed loudly 
for Rama saying 'oh, Rama,' which Rama has gone deep into the forest by then. [3-49-21]


Ravana who is infatuated with lust picked her up, which lady is disinclined for any kind of sensuality 
and who is verily writhing like the wife of King Cobra, and then he surged skyward and flew off with 
her in his air-chariot. [3-49-22]


While that lord of demons is abducting her in the skyway, Seetha became frenzied with bewildered faculties 
and then bawled stridently like a hysterical person. [3-49-23]


"Haa, greatly dextrous Lakshmana... oh, rejoicer of your mentor... you are incognisant of me who am 
being abducted by this demon who is a dissembler. [3-49-24]


"Oh, Raghava, you have relinquished your high-life, happiness, and riches for the sake of righteousness, 
and though you avowed to protect your observants, you are unobservant of me who am being abducted by 
the unrighteousness itself. [3-49-5]


"Oh, enemy-inflamer Rama, I reckon that you are an absolute controller of uncontrollable beings, I wonder 
why you are not controlling this kind of sinner, Ravana, indeed?" This is how Seetha started her cry 
in wilderness. [3-49-26]


"Indeed, the result for an evil act will not be apparent instantaneously. Even the time becomes a factor 
in the matter of cause and effect, as with the crops becoming cookable after certain time lag." Thus, 
she is addressing Ravana now. [3-49-27]


"The Time has battered your brains and as an infringer you have undertaken this particular exploit, 
whereby you will get a devastating and life-ending tribulation from Rama." Thus, she upbraided Ravana. 
[3-49-28]


"An honest wife of a glorious one who aspires nothing but honesty, such a wife of Rama as I am, I am 
being abducted, thus the aspiration of Kaikeyi and her kinfolk has now come true. Oh, god!" Thus, she 
soliloquised. [3-49-29]


"I call the attention of the flowered Karnikaara trees of Janasthaana, you inform Rama that Ravana is 
thieving Seetha." Thus, she is addressing the woods and others on the ground from air-chariot. [3-49-30]


"I pray you who are with the bustle of swans and saarasa water birds, oh, River Godavari, you promptly 
tell Rama that Ravana is thieving Seetha. [3-49-31]


"I also venerate you, the sylvan deities that travel in this forest with diverse trees or, those that 
abide on the treetops, you may please inform my husband that I am being stolen. [3-49-32]


"Or, over there, some few beings that are living over there on the ground below, I seek shelter of all 
the flocks of birds and hoards of animals, and I pray you to convey this news. [3-49-33]


"Inform my husband about his dear and loftier wife than his lives, saying that, 'helpless Seetha is 
stolen by Ravana.' [3-49-34]


"If that ambidextrous Rama comes to know about me, even if I am taken to heavens, or, even if I am impounded 
by Death, that great-mighty Rama brings me back, on aggressing against all of the gods in heaven, or, 
against Yama, the Death God." Thus, she appealed to one and all, but in vain. [3-49-35]


She that wide-eyed Seetha who is highly anguished and bewailing with pitiable words then with a wide-eyed 
expectancy saw the eagle Jatayu perching on a tree. [3-49-36]


She that well-waisted lady who has gone into the captivity of Ravana craned and stared at the eagle, 
and worsted by fear she shrieked squeakily with a stuttering voice that is walloped with anguish. [3-49-37]


"Oh, fatherly Jatayu, see me, like an orphanized one I am pitiably abducted by this lord of demons with 
sinister deeds. [3-49-38]


"It is impossible for you to forestall this merciless night-walker, for he is formidable, shining forth 
with cunning conquests, also thus this wicked minded one is with weaponry. [3-49-39]


"Oh, Jatayu, everything about my abduction shall be narrated to Rama, or to Lakshmana, as it has happened 
in its entirety." Thus Seetha supplicated Jatayu. [3-49-40]

When Ravana whose intention is to abduct her has enquired thus, then on the basis of his Brahman friar's 
mien Seetha informed about herself on her own. [3-47-1]


Thinking briefly that, 'he is a Brahman and an untimely guest, he will indeed curse me if he is not 
replied,' Seetha spoke this sentence. [3-47-2]


"I am the daughter of noble-souled Janaka, the king of Mithila, by name I am Seetha, and the dear wife 
and queen of Rama, let safety betide you. [3-47-3]


"On residing in the residence of Ikshvaku-s in Ayodhya for twelve years, I was in sumptuosity of all 
cherishes while relishing all humanly prosperities. [3-47-4]


"In the thirteenth year the lordly king Dasharatha deliberated together with his imperial ministers 
to anoint Rama as Crown Prince of Ayodhya. [3-47-5]


"When Raghava's anointment was being organised my venerable mother-in-law known as Kaikeyi begged her 
husband Dasharatha for a boon. [3-47-6]


"Restraining my veracious father-in-law by a good deed once done by her in his respect, Kaikeyi besought 
two boons from him, namely expatriation of my husband, and anointment of her son Bharata. [3-47-7, 8a]


" 'If Rama is anointed now, come what may I will not eat, sleep, or drink, and my life ends this way,' 
thus Kaikeyi was adamantine, and the king and my father-in-law entreated her who is nagging with meaningful 
riches, but she did not make good on that entreaty. [3-47-8b, 9, 10a]


"My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years 
are reckoned up from my birth. [3-47-10b, 11a]


"Rama - thus he is exalted in the world, an unambiguous, unblemished, unsullied one, and a broad-eyed 
ambidextrous one, who delights in bringing universal welfare, is my husband. [3-47-11b, 12a]


"But Rama's father Dasharatha was lovesick for Kaikeyi and to fulfil her desired aspiration that great 
king did not anoint Rama. [3-47-12b, 13a]


"When Rama arrived in the presence of his father, Kaikeyi readily and decidedly spoke these words to 
my husband. [3-47-b, 14a]


" 'What your father has proclaimed, oh, Raghava, that may be heard from me. He said, 'let this thornless 
kingdom be accorded to Bharata.' [3-47-14b, 15a]


"And you, oh, Kakutstha Rama, indeed have to inhabit the forests for nine plus five years, hence you 
repair to forests and redeem your father from the remorse of perjury.' [3-47-15b, 16a]


" 'As an unfearing one from any quarter and as a resolute one in his pledge my husband Rama said 'so 
be it' to Kaikeyi and followed her dictate. [3-47-16b, 17a]


"My husband is evermore a renderer but not a recipient, and forever he speaks truth, and not the untruth, 
least of all. Oh, Brahman, this is the unalterable and unsurpassable vow of Rama. [3-47-17b, 18a]


"One known as Lakshmana is such a Rama's brother from another mother, and he is a valorous one, tigerly-man, 
and an eliminator of enemies in war. [3-47-18b, 19a]


"He who is known as Lakshmana, a follower of virtue and steadfast in his commitment, followed Rama handling 
his bow as a helpmate, when Rama was proceeding to forests along with me. [3-47-19b, 20a]


"Because Rama always abides in probity and resolutely vowed to it, he entered Dandaka forest in the 
aspect of a tufty haired saint along with me and his brother. [3-47-20b, 21a]


"Such as we are, oh, eminent Brahman, we three are moving about the impenetrable Dandaka forest just 
by our own mettle as we fell down from kingdom owing to Kaikeyi. [3-47-21b, 22a]


"Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will 
be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches 
meat, aplenty. [3-47-22b, 23]


"Such as you are, oh, Brahman, you may make mention of your name, parentage and caste, in their actuality. 
For what reason you are wandering in Dandaka forest lonesomely?" Thus Seetha questioned Ravana. [3-47-24]


Ravana, the great-mighty king of demons, brusquely replied Seetha, the wife of Rama, while she is still 
speaking in this way. [3-47-25]


"Oh, Seetha, of whom all the worlds composed of gods, demons and humans are highly startled, I am that 
sovereign of hosts of demons, known as Ravana. [3-47-26]


"On seeing you, oh, impeccable one, glittering with golden complexion and attired in ochry-silks, I 
derive no pleasure in my wives. [3-47-27]


"You become my prime queen above all the choicest women with superior status, whom I have appropriated 
from here and there. [3-47-28]


"Nestled on a mountaintop my great city known as Lanka is there in the midst of an ocean and all over 
encompassed by an ocean. [3-47-29]


"Oh, Seetha, there you can saunter in pleasure-gardens along with me, and oh, lady with resentment, 
you will not think back to this forest-living, at all events. [3-47-30]


"Oh, Seetha, if you become my wife five thousand handmaidens adorned with ornaments of every description 
will be in your attendance." Thus Ravana said to Seetha. [3-47-31]


When Ravana said in this way, Seetha the daughter of Janaka, a flawless one by her physique, dishonoured 
and replied that demon. [3-47-32]


"I have avowed to adhere to such a husband Rama, who is inflexible like a sturdy mountain, comparable 
to lordly Indra, unshakable like a vast ocean. [3-47-33]


"He who is enriched with all endowments, and who is like a banyan tree with its surmounted orbicularity, 
the high-minded one with truthfulness alone is his target, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. 
[3-47-34]


"He who is ambidextrous, broad-chested, supreme among men, and a lion-like person with the strides of 
prancing lion, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. [3-47-35]


"He who is a valiant one with a face like that of full-moon, a prince with his self-conquered, and he 
who is expressly acclaimed and effectively armed, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. [3-47-36]


"You being a fox you woo me who am an absolutely inaccessible lioness? Why wooing, it is impossible 
for you to touch me as with the untouchable Shine of the Sun. [3-47-37]


"You who are an ill-fated demon, oh, demon, by your wooing the dear wife of Raghava, thus you must be 
visualising many golden trees, undeniably. [3-47-38]


"Do you wish to twitch fangs from the mouth of a ravenous lion, the expeditious challenger of animals, 
and from the mouth of a rebounding venomous serpent. [3-47-39]


"Do you wish to steal away the massive Mandara Mountain by the sleight of your hand, but how do you 
wish to decamp healthily without consuming lethal poison? [3-47-40]


"If you wish to override the dear wife of Raghava, then it is as good as wishing to deeply scrape your 
eyes with needlepoint, and licking the razorblade with your tongue. [3-47-41]


"You who wish to bitterly intimidate the dear wife of Rama are as good as the one who wish to swim an 
ocean arraying a boulder around his neck, and with a pair of hands you wish to steal away both the Sun 
and Moon? [3-47-42, 43a]


"You who wish to abduct me with an auspicious legend as the wife of Rama, thus you wish to steal away 
a glowing fire in a cloth-bundle, though evincing it to be highly flaming? [3-47-43b, 44a]


"You who wish to override the befitting and selfsame wife of Rama, are wishing to tread on the needle-sharp 
spikes of iron spears. [3-47-44b, c]


"Which odds are there between a lion and a fox in a given forest, which odds are there between a turbid-rivulet 
and an ocean, and which odds are there between a fine-wine and sour-gruel, likewise you are also at 
odds with the son of Dasharatha. [3-47-45]


"Which imparity is there among the metals of gold and lead, which imparity is there among the waters 
of sandalwood and sewage, which imparity is there between an elephant and a wildcat of forests, such 
an imparity exists between you and the son of Dasharatha. [3-47-46]


"Which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a crow and an eagle, which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a waterfowl 
and a peacock, which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a swan and a falcon living in forest, such a dissimilarity 
obtains betwixt you and the son of Dasharatha. [3-47-47]


"Even if you steal me away now, later when Indra similar Rama posits himself with his bow and arrows 
in hand on the battlefield, you cannot live on, and in the meanwhile you cannot digest me, as with a 
diamond swallowed along with a fly." Thus Seetha gave her vent to her disdainful feelings towards Ravana. 
[3-47-48]


On speaking these sentences with high-strung words, with all her unsullied intentions to that highly 
sullied night-rambler Ravana, her fragile body trembled tormentedly as with a banana plant up-heaved 
by gust. [3-47-49]


On closely marking Seetha to be tremulous, he that Ravana whose impetus is Death similar, clearly informed 
her of his name, caste, competency, and capability as his purpose is to cause scare. [3-47-50]

On showing a concept for questing after Seetha that context-sensitive Kabandha further spoke this sentence 
which is inclusive of right concept to Rama. [3-73-1]


"Oh, Rama, have a recourse to westward, and where the trees of Rose-apple, Priyaala, Jackfruit, Plaksha, 
Banyan, Tinduka, Pipal, Karnikara, Mango, and others... and even trees like Dhanva, Naaga, Tilaka, Naktamaala, 
blue Ashoka, Kadamba, Karaviira, Agnimukha, Ashoka, red-sandalwood trees and Neem trees will be heart-pleasingly 
shining forth in full blossom, that alone is an optimistic course for you. [3-73-2, 3, 4, 5a]


"On shinning up those trees, or else, even on forcefully pelting those fruits down onto ground, then 
you may pelt over, devouring those ambrosial fruits... [3-73-5b, 6a]


"On crossing over that parkland, oh, Kakutstha, another parkland with blossomy flowers is there, which 
replicates the heavenly Nandana gardens, and a replica of North-Kuru, an all-endowing province... [3-73-6b, 
7a]


"Wherein the trees fruit all-season fruits that transude nectar, why fruits alone, in that parkland 
all seasons are coeval, as they will be in Caitraratha, the celestial gardens of Kubera... [3-73-7b, 
8a]


"In there, the trees bear enormous branches which will be crouching under the weight of their own fruits, 
and everywhere such trees will be shining forth like shiny clouds and shining mountains... [3-73-8b, 
9a]


"Let Lakshmana present those ambrosial fruits to you either by climbing up those trees to pluck them, 
or else by pelting them to ground, according to his convenience... [3-73-9b-10a]


"Peregrinating finest places by trekking from mountain to mountain, from forest to forest, oh, valorous 
ones, you will trek to an auspicious lotus-lake, called Pampa... [3-73-10b, 11a]


"It is un-pebbly, un-slippery, un-weedy thereabouts, oh, Rama, equal are its quaysides and emersed are 
its sandbanks, red and blue lotuses beautify that Pampa Lake... [3-73-11b, 12a]


"There the indwellers of Pampa Lake's waters, oh, Raghava, namely the swans, cranes, Kraunca-s and fish-hawks 
will be letting out peeps in tuneful voice... [3-73-12a, 13b]


"Thereabout birds will be unflustered on seeing humans, because they are artless to avoid hunting, because 
none kills them, and you may savour them because those birds will be best and burley, similar to ghee-gobs... 
[3-73-13b, 14a]


"Oh, Rama in that Pampa Lake there are best fishes, red-carps, and blunt-snouted small porpoises, and 
a sort of sprats, which are neither scraggy, nor with many fish-bones. Lakshmana will reverentially 
offer them to you on skewering them with arrow, and on broiling them on iron rod of arrow after descaling 
and de-finning them. [3-73-14b, 15, 16a]


"While you eat those fishes to satiety, Lakshmana will offer you the water of Pampa Lake, which will 
be in the bunches of flowers of that lake, and which will be lotus-scented, pellucid, comfortably cool, 
shiny like silver and crystal, uncontaminated and that way pristine, by lifting it up that water with 
lotus leaf, making that leaf a stoup-like basin... [3-73-16b, 17, 18a]


"Oh, best one among men Rama, at Pampa you will see best shaped Vanara-s who have their bunk bed in 
mountain caves, and who will be coming nearby the lake, greedy as they are for water, and those forest 
movers will be moving about in evening time of the day, bellowing like bulls... oh, Rama, Lakshmana 
will show them to you... [3-73-18b, 19, 20a]


"While roving in the evenings, oh, Rama, should you see the serenely water of Pampa, with her trees 
garlanded with their own blooms and twigs, you will discard your own dolour... [3-73-20b, 21a]


"Oh, Raghava, there you will see highly delightful and wide-ranging trees like Tilaka and Naktamaala, 
and fully bloomed red and blue lotuses, as well... [3-73-21b, 22a]


"Oh, Raghava, there is none someone to inwreathe the garlands of those flowers, and indeed, they neither 
dry up, nor drop down... [3-73-22b, 23a]


"Erst there were self-collected sages, the disciples of Sage Matanga, and at one time while they were 
bringing the forest produce as ritual paraphernalia, they were much wearied by its weight and they were 
sweating... and all of those earthbound strings of sweat-drops that quickly dropped from their bodies 
were wafted by air onto trees, and on them they reoccurred as strings of flowers, by the merit of the 
ascesis of those sages... oh, Raghava, since those flowers have emerged from sweat-drops, they are imperishable, 
indeed... [3-73-23b, 24, 25]


"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, albeit the passing of those sages through the pearly gates, their maidservant, 
a long-lived one and an anchoress, named Shabari, can be seen there, even today... [3-73-26]


"Oh, Rama, she who always stands by probity will depart to the sphere of heaven, on attending to you, 
for you are the referent to god, and a reverent for one and all... [3-73-27]


"Oh, Rama, thereafter on your taking course to that western bank of Pampa Lake, oh, Kakutstha, there 
you will see the unequalled and arcane place of hermitage of sage Matanga... [3-73-28]


"Sage Matanga so methodised that woodland, where even the elephants are rendered incapable to trespass 
in that hermitage of sage Matanga disturbing its serenity... [3-73-29]


"Oh, the legatee of Raghu, that woodland which in simile is like a godly forest, similar to the heavenly 
Nandana gardens, overspread with divers birds is renowned as 'Matanga woodland', and oh, Rama, you will 
take delight rejoicingly in that woodland... [3-73-30, 31a]


"In front of Pampa there is a bountiful but an unclimbable mountain is there with trees in full blossom, 
which is well-protected by baby elephants, and which in earlier times was purposefully created by Brahma, 
and that alone is Mt. Rishyamuka... [3-73-31b, 32]


"And should a man sleep on the heights of that mountain, and should he dream of gaining some riches 
in that sleep, he gains that much when he wakes up... [3-73-33]


"But he who is diabolic in his deportment and devilish in comportment, climbs that and hopes to sleep 
soundly, demons capture him while he is in sleep, and rough him up to death, there itself... [3-73-34]


"Oh, Rama, there the blaring trumpet-blasts of baby elephants that amuse themselves at Lake Pampa, and 
of those that are the indwellers of Matanga hermitage, even there on Mt. Rishyamuka are audible... [3-73-35]


"The mighty and massy dark-cloud coloured elephants will be hitting head-on, and with dripping blood 
streams on their jumbo heads and temples, they disperse and move about separately, only to come together 
for yet another round of head-to-head collision... [3-73-36]


"There the elephants are quenched on drinking water of Pampa Lake, that is daintily clean, and neatly 
clear, springlike for touch, and in which all scents of flowers of that lake are included, and then 
they will be collectively re-entering the forests, for they are forest ranging elephants... [3-73-37, 
38a]


"On your seeing the bears, also thus the tigers and even the exultant sapphire-blue Rurus with black 
stripes there, you will discard your distress... [3-73-38b, 39a]


"But oh, Rama, a cavernous cave lidded with a boulder stone outshines on that mountain, and oh, Kakutstha, 
problematic is an entry into it... [3-73-39b, 40a]


"On its right at its eastern opening a delightful lake with highly coolant waters is there, fringed 
with divers trees and fraught with numerous tubers and fruits... [3-73-40b, 41a]


"Sugreeva dwells in that cave along with four other monkeys, and at times he will be available on the 
peaks of that mountain, even on its bluffs and cliffs, for he is a terrified monkey..." Thus Kabandha 
informed them. [3-73-41b, 42a]


That impressive Kabandha adorned with divine garlands and abiding in sky scintillating with the grandeur 
of the dazzle of the sun has bidden both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana thus, awaited a bid adieu 
from them. [3-73-42b, 43a]


Rama and Lakshmana who started off on their peregrination said this sentence to that highly providential 
Kabandha, who is temporising in the sky in their vicinity, thus as "you may proceed..." [3-73-43b, 44a]


On getting the orders for departure from those two brothers who are highly gladdened at the information 
given by Kabandha, he that Kabandha who is ready to exit, he further said to them thus, "proceed for 
the purpose of achieving your task..." [3-73-44b, 45]


Kabandha who redeemed his divine form has now got an aureole around him, and while irradiance is tamping 
whole of his mien, he moved further up on sky and reappeared. And staying in the sky he pointed out 
at the side of Mt. Rishyamuka, and then he reiterated, "you befriend Sugreeva..."and then he vanished.

Rama, the great-resplendent, spoke these words forbiddingly albeit softly to Khara who lost his chariot 
but staying his course wielding a mace. [3-29-1]


"Although you hold sway over a gigantic force abounding with elephants horses and chariots, you have 
perpetrated heinous deeds in Dandaka forests that are loathsome to all the worlds, that is unseemliest 
to this soldiery. [3-29-2]


"One who causes suffering to living beings, besides being a transgressor and completely ruthless, he 
does not stand up for himself even if he were to be the lord of all the three worlds. [3-29-3]


"All people will eliminate him, oh, nightwalker, who is imperious and an infringer of worldly routine, 
as they would eradicate a vicious serpent, in the event of its running across them. [3-29-4]


"He who goes on performing evils selfishly, obsessively, heedlessly, more so delightedly, he will see 
the results of his own doings, like red-tailed-lizard on its eating self-destructive hailstones, obsessively 
and delightedly. [3-29-5]


"The residents of Dandaka forest are the highly-propitious sages that tread the path of virtue, and 
oh, demon, what benefit you gain in killing them, really? [3-29-6]


"Even if a fortune is made for a lavish living with an iota of merit, the evildoers, that too reprobates, 
further more those that are abominated by world will not last long, no more that petrified tree trunks. 
[3-29-7]


"One who undertakes evildoings will definitely and seasonably reap their fruits, which in his case will 
be ghoulish, as with the flowering of trees according to season. [3-29-8]


"In the world one acquires the fruit of profane acts not before long, oh, nightwalker, and it will be 
like venomous food devoured. [3-29-9]


"I am the king who arrived to exterminate the lives of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even 
of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation of world.


"I am the one who arrived at the behest of the king Dasharatha, or Bharata to exterminate the lives 
of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation 
of world. [3-29-10]


"Now, my arrows that are decorated in gold will be released on you like snakes rebounding from a snake-pit, 
and they will tear you asunder, and on riving you they will bounce back into my quivers. [3-29-11]


"Now eliminated in war, you along with your army will tread behind those sages that were treading the 
path of virtue, on whom you have so far feasted in Dandaka forest. [3-29-12]


"Let the supreme sages who were earlier slain by you may now see abiding on their aircrafts, your abidance 
in hellish death pangs when assaulted with my arrows. [3-29-13]


"Attack me as you wish... make an effort... you the knave of your clan... now I am going to toss your 
head down like a palm-fruit..." Thus Rama addressed Khara. [3-29-14]


But when Rama said thus, Khara is infuriated and convulsed in anger, and he replied Rama with bloodshot 
eyes, laughing boisterously. [3-29-15]


"On killing average demons in war, oh, son of Dasharatha, how you praise yourself when you yourself 
are un-praiseworthy?" Thus Khara started to speak to Rama. [3-29-16]


"Those best of men that are victorious and mighty will not boast anything, for they will be really proud 
of their own valour. [3-29-17]


"Oh, Rama, as to how undignified Kshatriya-s that are frivolous and irresolute in self-confidence will 
boast in the world, likewise you too are boasting in a meaningless manner. [3-29-18]


"Who will be that valiant that speaks about his lineage at wartime, that too, when the death-time is 
looming large! And, there will there be someone who broaches his self-extols in such an inopportune 
situation, is it! [3-29-19]


"Howsoever your ignominy is well shown by your self-praise, like the manifestation of gold on the tip 
of grass-blade burnt by fire, where the fire on grass-blade is no fire, and the bulb of fire appearing 
at the tip of grass-blade as a bulb of gold, is no gold. [3-29-20]


"But you are seeing me wielding a mace and standing before you like an unshakable and jagged mountain 
laden with ores, isn't it! [3-29-21]


"As to how the Terminator wielding noose is enough to take away all the lives in all the three worlds, 
handling my mace I am enough for detracting your life from you. [3-29-22]


"Even though much is to be said in your respect I will not continue to say, for the sun is getting at 
the dusk thereby disruption to war occurs. [3-29-23]


"You have killed fourteen thousand demons and on killing you I will wipe the tears of the wives of those 
dead demons today itself." Khara said so to Rama. [3-29-24]


Saying thus that highly infuriated Khara hurled his mace towards Rama, around which there are superb 
golden cinctures, and which is extremely glaring like a thunderbolt. [3-29-25]


Forcefully discharged from Khara's hands that highly fiery and stupendous mace rendering trees and shrubs 
down to ashes darted towards Rama. [3-29-26]


When that monstrous mace similar to the halter of the Terminator is swooping down, Rama smashed it to 
smithereens with his arrows while it is still sky rocketing. [3-29-27]


That mace splintered with arrows of Rama fell crumbling onto the surface of earth as a springing female 
snake would fall down by the strength of spells and nostrums. [3-29-28]

She that Vaidehi who is haggard by anguish boldly spoke to Ravana when he addressed her in that way, 
duly placing a blade of straw in between herself and Ravana. [3-56-1]


"He whose son is Raghava, is a resolute king known as Dasharatha. That king is a kingly rampart for 
righteousness, a kingpin abiding in forthrightness and thereby his kingliness is well renowned in all 
worlds, and my husband Rama is such a king's son. [3-56-2]


"Such a Dasharatha's son who is virtue-souled one, who is highly renowned in all the three worlds for 
his ambidexterity and perspicacity, and who is known as Rama is my husband and a god to me. [3-56-3]


"He who took birth in Ikshvaku's dynasty is a great-resplendent one with his shoulders like those of 
a lion, and who comes here along with similarly lion-shouldered and nearly great-resplendent brother 
of his, namely Lakshmana, to take your lives away. Such Rama is my husband. [3-56-4]


"Had I been forcibly humiliated by you in the presence of Rama, you too would have been killed by Rama 
in combat and by now you too would be sprawling on earth, as with Khara in Janasthaana, but you foxed 
him. However, such Rama is my husband. [3-56-5]


"Those demons who are spoken of you to be with ghastly forms and gruelling power, they all will become 
formless and powerless in face of Raghava, as with all snakes becoming non-poisonous earthworms in the 
face of Garuda, the Divine Eagle. Such Rama is my husband. [3-56-6]


"Those gilded arrows of Rama unloosened directly and unswervingly from his bowstring will utterly batter 
your body, as the waves of River Ganga will be battering that river's riverbanks. Such Rama is my husband. 
[3-56-7]


"Even if you are unkillable either by gods or by demons, you Ravana, you will not be disenthralled by 
Rama while you are alive, for you hatched a very great animosity in him against you. [3-56-8]


"That mighty Rama will become the terminator of the vestige of your life, and as with an animal fastened 
to the stake of sacrifice your life too will become irretrievable. [3-56-9]


"If he that Rama glances you with his rancour-torched eyes, you demon, you will be completely burnt 
down now itself, as with Love-god burnt down by Furious Shiva. [3-56-10]


"He that Rama who hurls down the moon from skies onto earth, or else extirpates it if need be, or even 
desiccates an ocean, he alone rescues Seetha from here. [3-56-11]


"Gone is your liveability, gone is your prosperity, gone is your vivacity, and gone is your faculty. 
Thus Lanka is widowed by a single deed of yours. [3-56-12]


"In forest you have separated me from the propinquity of my husband, which diabolic deed of yours will 
not result in any ultimate happiness for you. [3-56-13]


"In fact, that great-resplendent husband of mine, Rama, is still residing in the eremitical Dandaka 
forest, bravely hinging on to his own valour, in tandem only with my brother-in-law. [3-56-14]


"With storms of his arrows in a given combat my husband will dislodge arrogance, insolence, puissance, 
like that impudence from every limb of yours. [3-56-15]


"As and when ruination of created beings manifests actuated by Time, then all of them will place their 
behaviour in endangerment, as they have gone under the control of End-Time. [3-56-16]


"This is that time which has bechanced on you owing to your molesting me, you basely demon, by which 
time-factor yourself, all of your demons, and even all of your queens in the Chambers of Queens will 
be devastated. [3-56-17]


"It is impossible for a profaner to heavily tread on the Altar of Fire amidst a Ritual Hall surrounded 
by oblational vessels, further sanctified by Vedic hymns. [3-56-18]


"Likewise, I am the solemnly pledged legitimate wife of one who steadied himself in righteousness, and 
such as I am, you basely demon, it is impossible for you trespasser to touch me even. [3-56-19]


"How a she-swan ever frolicking with majestic swans in bunches of lotuses can leer at a water-crow sneaking 
in a bunch of grass? [3-56-20]


"Oh, demon, you may either trammel or vandalise this inertial body of mine. I claim neither this body 
nor life of mine as my own. But I am intolerant to bear with any disrepute on this earth." Thus Seetha 
castigated Ravana. [3-56-21, 22a]


Vaidehi on speaking those highly caustic words angrily to Ravana in this way, she that Maithili spoke 
no more in that matter. [3-56-22b, 23a]


On hearing Seetha's scathing and hair-raising censures, then Ravana retorted with these intimidatory 
chides. [3-56-23b, 24a]


"Oh, angry lady Maithili, listen to my words. A period of twelve months is given to you. And oh, smiley 
smiler, if you do not come nigh of me within that period, then the cooks will slice you to pieces for 
the purpose of a morning meal." [3-56-24b, 25]


Thus on saying those harsh words, Ravana, the one who makes his enemies to bewail, and who is now infuriated 
said this sentence to the guarding demonesses. [3-56-26]


"Oh, gnarled demonesses of grisly mien and devourers of meat and blood, you have to indeed remove her 
pride immediately. [3-56-27]


Just by that order of Ravana those demonesses of grotesque and ugly appearance have obediently made 
palm-fold to him and encircled Maithili. [3-56-28]


That king Ravana paced in an earth-shattering manner as though to cleave it and clearly said this to 
those demonesses with ghastly look. [3-56-29]


"Let this Maithili be taken to the centre of Ashoka gardens, where you all shall blockade and guard 
her stealthily. [3-56-30]


"You threaten her with dreadful admonitions and again speaking imploringly you all have to bring her 
under control, as a wild she-elephant of age will be brought under control. [3-56-31]


When Ravana has clearly ordered, those demonesses on their part took Maithili to Ashoka garden. That 
Ashoka gardens are surrounded with trees that yield fruits to every savour, and now they are diversely 
flowered and fruited. Further, those gardens are highly adored by all-time lusty birds. [3-56-32, 33]


But she that Janaka's daughter Maithili whose body is with a coverall of anguish, further on obtaining 
the control of demonesses, she is as good as a she-deer under the coverall of tigresses. [3-56-34]


Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, who is already consumed by utmost agony has not obtained any placidity 
now as with a she-deer bound by tether - where timorousness is common to both. [3-56-35]


Maithili knows no peace when the bizarre-eyed demonesses have highly intimidated her, and by shut-seeing 
those demonesses her reminiscences went over to her dear husband and about her brother-in-law Lakshmana 
too, and when she felt about the improbability of their coming here, she is distraught with alarm and 
anguish, and then she swooned. [3-56-36]

Seetha whose visage is like a full moon wept on gazing the king of eagles Jataayu whom Ravana nearly 
killed. [3-52-1]


"Humans definitely perceive either agony or ecstasy by its concomitant happenings, or by the characteristics 
of uncommon reflexes of their own body parts, or by the presages, or by conjecturable concomitants, 
or by cognising calls of birds. [3-52-2]


"Oh, Rama, for sure you are not able to know about big catastrophe called my kidnap is chancing on you, 
even though oh, Kakutstha, these animals and birds are running towards you surely for my sake, to tell 
about me. [3-52-3]


"Oh, Rama, this sky flier Jataayu who mercifully came here to save me is verily mangled on his encountering 
Ravana, and he is sprawling on earth, indeed by my ill luck." Thus Seetha wailed. [3-52-4]


That best lady who is very highly panicked bawled noisily, "oh, Rama of Kakutstha... oh, Lakshmana... 
liberate me now..." as though the addressees are before her. [3-52-5]


That sovereign of demons, Ravana, rushed towards Vaidehi whose garlands and jewellery are muddled up 
and who is bawling like an orphanized one. [3-52-6]


Ravana, the lord of demons, has repeatedly and harshly taunted Seetha saying, 'leave it off, leave it 
off...' when Seetha devoid of Rama in that timberland is clinging and muffling a sturdy tree like a 
climber plant, and bawling, 'Rama, Rama,' and that demon whose shine is similar to the Death has clutched 
her hair loosened from her bun, as death loomed large on him. [3-52-7, 8]


While Vaidehi is insulted thus, entire world together with its mobile or sessile beings became chaotic, 
and there chanced a blanketing of a blinding blackness, and waft-less is the Wind and shine-less is 
the Sun. [3-52-9]


On seeing Seetha's appropriation by an inappropriate being with His clairvoyant eyes, the illustrious 
Grandparent of Universe Brahma declared, "the deed is done..." but all of the supreme sages in Brahma's 
abode on seeing Seetha in such a condition became despondent, and yet delighted in foreseeing results. 
[3-52-10b, 11a]


On seeing Seetha's appropriation by an impropriate being, the dwellers in Dandaka forest cognised that 
Ravana's annihilation has chanced coincidentally. [3-52-12]


Ravana, the lord of demons, on wresting Seetha who is bawling, "Rama... Rama..." also thus as, "Lakshmana..." 
took flight skyward. [3-52-13]


That princess Seetha scintillated like the oblique flashes of lightning in a cloud, owing to her golden 
coloured body which is muffled up with jewellery of pure gold, and added with a golden coloured ocherish 
silky dress, while traversing in the sky. [3-52-14]


When her ochreish silk sari's upper fringe is upheaved by air onto to Ravana, Ravana looked blazing 
like a mountain set ablaze, muchly and overly. [3-52-15]


Reddish and scented lotus-petals adorning that highly auspicious Seetha have slithered, but again upheaved 
by air they are bestrewn on Ravana. [3-52-16]


Upper fringe of Seetha's silk sari with golden glitter is upheaved in the sky, and with the reddish 
hue of sun in red heat of midday it beamed forth like a reddish cloud. [3-52-17]


As with a stalk-less lotus the immaculate visage of Seetha is unbright in the sky when she is on the 
flank of Ravana as Rama is not in vicinage. [3-52-18]


Her lotus pistil like un-pimply face is adorned with a pretty forehead on which prettyish curls are 
fluttering, and with teeth that are spick and span and sparkling, but tears dabbed on that face to sideways 
when she wept, yet it is pleasant like moon for a sight with shapely nose, pretty eyes, roseate lips, 
and shining with golden hue in sky. Nevertheless, when she has gone in the flank of Ravana on the sky 
such an immaculate face of Seetha turned like a palish moon that has just risen bursting a bluish cloud. 
[3-52-19, 20, 21]


Highly disconcerted by the king of demons that auspicious face of Seetha is unbright like the moon arisen 
in daytime with somewhat golden hue, owing to the absence of Rama. [3-52-22]


She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone forth 
like a sapphirine gemstone studded in a golden cincture.&nbsp;


She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone 
forth like a golden cincture girded to an elephant. [3-52-23]


Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, with a complexion that is goldenly yellowish in the tinge of a lotus, 
moreover with her ornaments of purified gold, flashed like a lightning possessed in a dark-cloud, when 
that stonehearted Ravana possessed her. [3-52-24]


With the rustles of Vaidehi's jewellery that lord of demons shone forth like a shipshape blue-black 
cloud with rumbles and undulating lightning. [3-52-25]


Flowers gracing her best body on her head, in garlands on chest, and on armlets have fallen all-over 
the surface of earth like showers of flowers while she is being abducted. [3-52-26]


Though that flower-shower has fallen all-over, it is windswept by the speed of Ravana, and fell again 
on that Decahedral demon. [3-52-27]


Like the garland of pristine stars that circles round the loftiest Mt. Meru, that flower-shower circled 
Ravana, the brother of Kubera. [3-52-28]


Slid from the left foot of Vaidehi her anklet adorned with gems fell down onto the plane of earth like 
an electric annulus with its sparky sparkles. [3-52-29]


She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of 
demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, herself becoming a golden girdle girded around the elephant 
like Ravana.


She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of 
demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, as with an elephant, with a golden girdle, stabled in an elephant-stable 
by a mahout, the elephant-trainer. [3-52-30]


Ravana, the brother of Kubera, on invading the sky abducted that radiant Seetha who is radiating the 
sky by her own radiancy like a massive meteor. [3-52-31]


Some of her ornaments which are lustrously flamy, for they are sparkling like the sparkles of fireworks, 
are strewn about on the plane of earth with much clatter like the stars pelted down from the sky. [3-52-32]


A multi-string pearl pendant, a rivi�re, that vies with the moonshine has glissaded from the medial 
of her breasts, and while glissading from sky it is sheeny like River Ganga while she glissaded from 
skies. [3-52-33]


The trees on which diverse birds are perching have been stirred up with the wind blown and up-heaved 
by the gust of Ravana's flight, while the swaying motion of those treetops is as though waving hands 
to console Seetha saying, "fear not... fear not..." [3-52-34]


With wilted lotuses and scared fishes and other beings moving in water the lotus lakes are unenthusiastically 
sorrowing for Maithili as though Seetha is their girlfriend.


The lakes with lotuses as their faces, and fishes as their eyes, and with the other facial adornments 
like the swimming, sweeping and sailing water-moving beings like tortoises, waterfowls and the like 
are unenthused, for a similar girlfriend of theirs, the lotus-faced, fish-eyed, lotus-modelled Seetha 
is beleaguered, and thus they are sorrowing for such a selfsame Maithili. [3-52-35]


All lions, tigers, animals and birds have then gathered in herds from all-over and ran rancorously and 
pursuantly shadowing the shadow of Seetha. [3-52-36]


The mountains appeared bewailing with their waterfalls as shedding tears and with their peaks as upraised 
arms, while Seetha is thus being abducted. [3-52-37]


On seeing Vaidehi who is being abducted thus, magnificent Sun in firmament is saddened, and lowly weakened 
is his sunshine, palely whitened is his sun-disc, and faintly deadened is his solar constant. [3-52-38]


"When Ravana is abducting none other than the wife of Rama, then there is no probity. At such a juncture, 
how conscience can prevail? Unfounded are candour and compassion," thus the throngs of all beings overly 
regretted. [3-52-39, 40a]


Verily frightened are the fawns of deer, and their saddened faces are with tear shedding eyes with flustered 
looks, and they looked up and up at Seetha in sky and wept. [3-52-40b, 41a]


On seeing Seetha who is undergoing anguish in that way the sylvan deities physically shuddered in a 
worst way. [3-52-41b, 42a]


She who is looking searchingly at the plane of earth for Rama or Lakshmana, and truly bawling in high-pitched 
but mellowly voice calling "Rama, Lakshmana", and whose hair-lengths are tousled, and whose felicitous 
vermilion mark on her forehead is smudged very untidily, that Decahedral demon abducted such an uncompromising 
husband-devout, Vaidehi, only for his self-ruination. [3-52-42a, 43]


She who is already detracted from her kinsfolk in Mithila or in Ayodhya, that Maithili with pretty teeth 
and clean-cut smile is then distanced from the only two last kinsmen, for either Raghava or Lakshmana 
or both are unseen by her, and thus her face is paled for she is chastened by the cumber of consternation. 
[3-52-44]

Both the sons of that best king Dasharatha, on taking up westerly path in that forest travelled on the 
passage to Pampa as shown by Kabandha. [3-74-1]


Those two, Rama and Lakshmana, while seeing several of the ticketed trees on mountains which have nectarous 
fruits on them moved forward to see Sugreeva. [3-74-2]


Those two legatees of Raghu on making a sojourn on the mountaintop, they the Raghava-s drew nigh of 
the moorland on the westward of Pampa Lake. [3-74-3]


Then on getting at the westward moorland of that lotus-lake Pampa, there those two have spotted the 
idyllic hermitage of Shabari. [3-74-4]


On getting at that hermitage and on perusing at that picturesque environ that is wreathed round with 
several picturesque trees, those two came nigh of Shabari. [3-74-5]


On seeing them that sublimated yogi Shabari instinctively made palm-fold, got up imperatively, and then 
she braced the feet of Rama, and even that of sagacious Lakshmana, impressively. [3-74-6]


She gave them water for feet-wash and mouthwash, and other viands customarily affordable to visitants, 
and then Rama asked after that anchoress who is unflinchingly abiding in her duty. [3-74-7]


"Oh, ascetically wealthy lady, perchance your deterrents in ascesis are completely overcome, somehow... 
your ascetic practises culminating, someway... your annoyances and ailments are adjusted, somewhat... 
isn't it! [3-74-8]


"Oh, suave speaker, mayhap your sacred commitments are achieved, anywise... appeased is your self, anyway... 
and your subservience to your mentors brought to fruition, perchance... isn't it!" Thus Rama enquired 
with Shabari. [3-74-9]


When Rama asked her in this way she that Shabari who is a senescent anchoress, sublimated yogin and 
an adherent to the sublimated yogis of higher rank, informed Rama remaining in his vis-�-vis. [3-74-10]


"Just now, on your pleasing manifestation before me my ascesis is accomplished, and now only my birth 
is fructified, and now only my subservience to my mentors is well hallowed... [3-74-11]


"Oh, best one among men, now all my ascesis is fructified when I personally worshiped you, who are none 
other than the best god among gods, thus the heaven will also be there for me... [3-74-12]


"Oh, kind one, your blessed sight has sanctified me... and oh, endower of respect, by your beneficence 
I wish to go to those returnless worlds because I have subjugated those enemies of yours, viz.,
<font color="#B3003A">ari SaD varga-s</font> in me, and I think my prayer to you is justified because 
you are a subjugator of such enemies... [3-74-13]


"Divine aircrafts of unequalled refulgence have lifted those disciples of Sage Matanga in whose tendance 
I was, to welkin on your arriving at Chitrakuta... [3-74-14]


"Those knowers of probity, highly providential, and eminent-saints have told me, 'Rama will come to 
this highly blest hermitage of yours along with Soumitri... and you have to cordially welcome them as 
your guests, and on your seeing him you will go to best worlds, where merit remains undiminished...' 
[3-74-15, 16]


"Oh, best one among men Rama, thus I was told by those highly providential sages, oh, best one among 
men, oh, manly tiger, and I have gleaned various forest fruits and eatables that occur on the moorlands 
of Pampa Lake for your sake..." So said Shabari to Rama. [3-74-17]


When that graceful souled Rama is addressed thus by Shabari, he that Raghava enquiringly said this to 
that Shabari who is never ever debarred from esoteric knowledge and gnosis. [3-74-18b, 19a]


"Your and your preceptors' effectiveness is heard in effect from the wraith of the great souled Danu's 
son, Kabandha, and if you feel showing it like I wish to clearly see it, personally..." Thus Rama asked 
her to show hermitage. [3-74-19b, 20a]


On hearing those words voiced by Rama, Shabari started to show that unique woodland to both of them. 
[3-74-20]


"Oh, Rama the delight of Raghu's lineage... this one comparable to a crammed cloud that would be ever 
ready to yield much cherished cloudbursts, and compacted with animals and birds that are ever ready 
to enjoy seasonable rains, is that hermitage to which you have come, that way this woodland is well 
known as Matanga, meaning a cloud, or an elephant, or an elephantine cloud that showers blessings on 
all... and oh, highly resplendent Rama, you may see this nest, snuggery, where those contemplative souls, 
my teachers, used to conduct oblations into the Ritual-fires, orienting and worshipping them with Vedic 
hymns... [3-74-21b, 22]


"Where those great sages that are highly revered by me used to offer flowers with their extremely doddery 
hands in the worship the Altar of Fire, this alone is that Altar of Fire raised at western end... [3-74-23]


"Oh, best one from Raghu-s, by the efficacy of the ascesis of my teachers these Altars of Fire are with 
incomparable irradiance, and even now they are irradiating all of the directions with solemnity... see 
them... [3-74-24]


"Enervated by dieting and straining they were incapable to go for sea bathing, and just at their thought 
process all the seven seas came close by, in coalescence... see them... [3-74-25]


"On performing holy baths those sages have spread their jute cloths on those trees with their own doddering 
hands here at this place and oh, Raghu's legatee, those cloths did not dry even now by the touch of 
their hands... [3-74-26]


"Which garlands they have knotted together with black-lotuses and other flowers while they were worshiping 
gods, these are really those garlands, and indeed there is no discolouration to them... [3-74-27]


"You have seen what is seeable and you have listened what is listenable of this woodland in its entirety... 
thereby I wish to become a permittee, where you alone are my permitter, as I wish to castaway this sheathe 
of soul, called my body... to make that soul to move nigh of my teachers feet... [3-74-28]


"Of which sages this hermitage is, and of which sages I am also a maidservant, I soulfully go the proximity 
of those contemplative souls..." Thus, she appealed to Rama. [3-74-29]


Rama on hearing those duty-congruous words of Shabari along with Lakshmana, obtained a uniquely high 
rejoice and he also said, "astonishing is this..." [3-74-30]


Then Rama spoke to that Shabari who is firmed up in her faith towards her masters, "oh, saintly lady, 
you treated me with deference... thus may go to your cherished worlds, where you can solace yourself 
with your masters... [3-74-31]


Thus that way said by Rama in consent, she who is wearing tufty-matted hair, jute-cloths, and deerskin 
as her clothing, she offered herself as an oblation into Ritual-fire, and then like a flaring fire, 
she went to heaven alone. [3-74-32, 33a]


Now she appeared as an angle bejewelled with angelic ornaments, wearing angle's wraparound and angelical 
flowery tassels, and bedaubed with suchlike cosmetics, and as with the scintillations of electric sparks 
she scintillated that province. [3-74-33b, 34]


Shabari who is a perfect yogin with perfected meditative concentration, now went to that sanctum locus 
where the blest souls of those sublime sages, namely her masters, saunter. [3-74-35]

That slender-waisted Seetha whose limbs are flawless, whose complexion is like purified gold, and who 
is presently culling flowers is highly gladdened to observe the Golden Deer that is brightened in one 
flank with the colour of gold and the other is silvery, and she shouted for attention of her husband, 
and even that of Lakshmana who is presently weaponed. [3-43-1, 2]


"Oh, noble prince, come here," thus she called her husband and peered at the deer, and again she called, 
"really come with your younger brother quickly," and again gazed at the deer, and thus she oftentimes 
called and oftentimes saw the deer fondly. [3-43-3]


Those manly lions Rama and Lakshmana thus bidden by Vaidehi came there exploring that place and then 
they saw that Golden Deer. [3-43-4]


But Lakshmana became incredulous on seeing it and said to Rama, "I believe this deer to be that Maareecha, 
the demon." [3-43-5]


"Oh, Rama, when kings engaged in hunting games were delightedly moving in the forest, this Maareecha 
killed many of them resorting to many disguises, for he is a guise-changer by his wish. [3-43-6]


"Maareecha is an expert in many wiles and he has now assumed the form of this Golden-Deer, oh, manly 
lion, which is not more than the scintillating city of Gandharva-s, a city of wiles, which any trickster 
can create to make-believe. [3-43-7]


"Oh, Raghava, this kind of amazing animal with gemlike dapples is nonexistent in the world, isn't it. 
Hence, oh, lord of the world, this is truly a phantasm. No doubt about it." So said Lakshmana to Rama. 
[3-43-8]


While Lakshmana of Kakutstha-s is speaking thus, she who is self-satisfied as her heart is conjured 
by the cozenage, such a Seetha of a toothy smile deterred him and spoke. [3-43-9]


"Oh, nobleman's son, that delightful deer is stealing my heart, oh, dextrous one, bring it round, it 
will be our plaything. [3-43-10]


"Here in the threshold of our hermitage many animals with adorable manifestation are moving about in 
flocks and herds, say Caamara deer, like that Srimara deer. [3-43-11]


"Also the animals that are excellent in their form, say monkeys, are moving here. Likewise herds of 
Kinnara deer, spotted-deer, and even bears of great-might are freely moving here. [3-43-12]


"As to how this extraordinary deer is appearing, oh, king, by way of its brilliance, tameness, or by 
the lustre of its skin, I have not so far seen any coequal to this. [3-43-13]


"Diversely coloured, amazingly limbed, and spotted with gemlike dapples it is shining forth like a deer 
that is completely gemmy, and while nonchalantly moving before me it is enlivening the forest like the 
moon. [3-43-14]


"Ah, what a form, ah, what a brilliance, what a beautiful bleat! This amazingly limbed deer is wonderful, 
and this is stealing my heart, as it were. [3-43-15]


"It will be surprising if this deer draws into your capture alive and well, as it creates astonishment 
to one and all. [3-43-16]


"When we return to kingdom on completing our dwelling in forest this deer becomes a masterpiece in palace-chambers 
for us. [3-43-17]


"Oh, lord, the form of this deer creates an excellent jubilation to Bharata, to you the son of the nobleman, 
to my mothers-in-law, and also to me in palace-chambers. [3-43-18]


"Else if that best deer does not come into you capture while alive, oh tigerly-man, at the least its 
gorgeous deerskin will be remnant of it. [3-43-19]


"I wish to sit along with you on its golden deerskin, overlaying it on a seat of tender darbha grass-blades, 
in case the deer is felled. [3-43-20]


"Tradition says that this sort of unruly self-seeking is unbefitting to women, yet that deer's beautiful 
body is inducing curiosity in me." Seetha said so to Rama and remained waiting for his reply. [3-43-21]


As for that deer's horns they vie with excellent sapphires, its golden coat with the glitter of tender 
sun, and its ambience with silver spots on coat with a milk way containing twinkling stars, and by that 
reason even Raghava's heart is awestruck when he saw it. [3-43-22, 23a]


In this way, hearing the words of Seetha and observing that wondrous deer Raghava is also amused by 
its form, and even motivated by Seetha in fetching it, he delightedly spoke this word to his brother 
Lakshmana. [3-43-23b, 24]


"Lakshmana, behold this enthusiastic delight of Vaidehi. Oh, Soumitri, presently no other deer indeed 
with such an excellent form exists in this forest. Or else, does it exist in Nandana Gardens of Indra 
- no, it cannot be there; in the adjoins of Caitraratha Gardens of Kubera - no, it will not be there, 
then how can there be some deer on earth which is similar to this! [3-43-25, 26]


"Amazing are its hairlines with hair upturned at some places and down-turned at other, and the golden 
spots embedded on the coat of the deer are glittery. [3-43-27]


"See at its tongue that is exserting from its mouth while it is yawning, which is similar to the flaring 
tongue of fire and to the lightning from a cloud. [3-43-28]


"Its face is like a mug made up of sapphires, its paunch is pearly and conchoidal, and whose heart is 
it that will not lured for this deer with an inexplicable beauty. [3-43-29]


"On seeing at this astounding look of the deer which is golden in glitter and bejewelled numerously 
as it were, whose heart is it that will not be transported into astonishment. [3-43-30]


"Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the 
sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery. [3-43-31]


"And exerting themselves in great forests they by far amass forest produce, ores, jewels, gemstones 
and the gravel of gold. [3-43-32]


"Everything of that wealth from forest produce will be filling the treasuries of kings, like the speculated 
objects filling the entire treasury of Shukra just by his thinking of them in his mind. [3-43-33]


"The financial experts and the other financially well-off people say that with which aspirational activity 
an aspirant unhesitatingly scurries and achieves it, that achieved target alone is lauded to be worthwhile, 
or, as real wealth. [3-43-34]


"This comely Vaidehi will be sitting on that invaluable golden skin of that gem of a deer along with 
me. [3-43-35]


"I think the skin of Kadali deer, or of Priyaki deer, or of Praveni deer, or as a matter of fact the 
skins of best breed of deer or sheep will not be match to the deerskin of this deer, insofar as the 
soft-touch is concerned. [3-43-36]


"Only two divine deer are there, this magnificent deer on earth, and the other that moves in skies remaining 
in stellar region. [3-43-37]


"You are telling me that 'this is the wizardry of the demon.' Even then, Lakshmana, if this results 
in that way as a demon's wizardry, my duty also results in the elimination of that deer. [3-43-38]


"If this deer is Maareecha, this heinous and vicious-souled demon has indeed tortured many eminent sages 
earlier when was on the prowl in the forests, thus he is eliminable. [3-43-39]


"He rebelliously killed many kings who are excellent archers while they were in hunting games, at least 
for that reason this bestial monster is eradicable. [3-43-40]


"Demon Vaataapi who held ascetics in contempt was here earlier, and staying in the stomachs of Brahmans 
he used to come out by ripping their stomachs open and thus he was killing Brahmans, like a mare-calf 
killing its own mother at its time of birth by ripping the womb of its own mother. [3-43-41]


"On one occasion after some time, that Vaataapi avariciously obtained that great-saint and the one who 
is endowed with effulgent, namely Agastya, as an eatable, but actually that demon has became an eatable 
to the sage. [3-43-42]


"On observing the demon Vaataapi who is trying to assume his original form of demon in order to come 
out of his stomach, that godly saint Agastya spoke this to Vaataapi with a scornful smile. [3-43-43]


" 'Oh, Vaataapi, you have irreverently eradicated the best Brahmans in this world owing to your might, 
therefore I have assimilated you.' So said sage Agastya to Vaataapi. [3-43-44]


"Lakshmana, such a demon who is like Vaataapi will not be there any more. He who disregards someone 
of my kind, who always abides in righteousness and who is self-controlled, such a demon will be eliminated 
as sage Agastya has eliminated demon Vaataapi, if that demon happens to get at me. [3-43-45, 46a]


"Oh, Lakshmana, the descendent of Raghu, you stay here in all preparedness and guard Maithili steadfastly, 
whatever enterprise of ours is there that is founded in her. [3-43-46b, 47a]


"I wish to catch this deer, Soumitri, if not I will kill it, and I will be going forthwith to fetch 
the deer. [3-43-47b, 48a]


"Lakshmana, see how Vaidehi's percept is overtaken by deerskin. Indeed by the strangeness of its skin 
that deer must be a mysterious being, hence, it will not survive now. [3-43-48]


"Oh, Lakshmana, apply yourself vigilantly while staying in hermitage along with Seetha. So soon as I 
go I will be felling that spotted deer with one arrow and returning quickly. [3-43-49b, 50]


"Oh, Lakshmana, you be here taking care of Maithili along with the forthright, formidable and fatherly 
bird Jatayu, and be watchful and suspicious from everywhere and every split-second." Thus Rama spoke 
to Lakshmana and started to go after the deer [3-43-51]

On hearing the exciting advise of Shuurpanakha then Ravana bade adieu to ministers, and indeed on resolving 
his further task he proceeded to his personal palace chambers. [3-35-1]


While following up his thinking about that task he got a pertinent thought, and on deliberating about 
the credits and discredits, strengths and weaknesses of that thought he decided that 'this is to be 
done in this method only.' On taking a decision in that way and with a firm mind he indeed proceeded 
to his excellent vehicle-garage. [3-35-2, 3]


That lordly demon then has gone to the vehicle garage in secrecy, and directed the charioteer thus as, 
'let the chariot be harnessed.' [3-35-4]


When that brisk-paced charioteer is said in this way he instantly harnessed the favourite and choicest 
chariot of Ravana with horses and got it ready. [3-35-5]


That chariot which is decorated with golden ornaments, yoked with monster-faced mules that have gem 
studded trappings is rideable by the wish of the rider, and sitting in such a chariot which is wholly 
golden and which rides with a sound like the pealing of thunder, that celebrated Ravana, the brother 
of Kubera and the lord of demons, travelled towards the lord of rivers and rivulets, namely the ocean. 
[3-35-6,7]


Dasha-aanana, the decahedral demon, whose complexion like the smoothened Lapis-gem is lustrous, whose 
regalia that comprise white long-furred fans, white parasol and the like is spectacular, whose ornaments 
made out of refined gold are glittering, who similar to a kingly mountain with ten pinnacles and crags 
by way of his ten heads and twenty arms is gorgeous, and such a chief of demons who by that way is an 
adversary of gods and cutthroat of eminent-sages, seated in a nitid golden chariot that is rideable 
by the wish of its steersman, he shone forth like a black-cloud fringed with the streaks of lightning 
and rimmed with flights of cranes. [3-35-8, 9, 10]


That dauntless Ravana forged ahead while viewing the area along the coastline which is interspersed 
with thousands of mountains and which is with variously flowered and fruited trees. [3-35-11]


Everywhere the coastland is bedecked with lotus-lakes containing clean and cool waters, and with extensive 
thresholds of hermitages containing Fire-altars. [3-35-12]


Entire coast is gleaming with banana plantation and glistening with coconut trees, and the saala, palm, 
and tamaala trees are also in full blossom. [3-35-13]


It is brightened up with thousands of reptiles and birds, with those many celestial beings that frequent 
the earth like gandharva-s, kinnaraa-s. And with eminent sages who have highly controlled food-habits, 
as well. It is also refulgent with the self-denying Siddha-s, Carana-s, and with sages that are the 
brainchildren of Brahma, namely Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s. [3-35-14, 15]


With thousands of celestial maidens divine in their mien, namely apsara-s, who are prettified with divine 
ornaments and garlands, and who are also the experts in the methodical sex-games that seaside is pervaded. 
[3-35-16]


That seacoast is adored by the propitious wives of gods and frequented by the assemblages of gods who 
thrive upon ambrosia, and even patronised by demons that strive for ambrosia. [3-35-17]


It is spread with swans, ruddy-gees and frogs, and there the waterfowls are very noisy, and stones overlain 
on the coast are like lapis-gems, and with the ambience of ocean that whole delta is appearing smooth 
and sludgy. [3-35-18]


While Ravana, the brother of Kubera, is quickly transiting he saw everywhere the whitish and widish 
aircrafts belonging to the deified souls who acquired higher worlds, and from those aircrafts adorned 
with divine flowery tassels and piloted by the wish of their steersmen, instrumental and vocal music 
is resonating, and gandharva-s are singing and apsara-s are dancing in them. [3-35-19, 20]


Ravana proceeded while observing thousands of woodlands with sandalwood trees that are soothing and 
satisfying the sense of smell, and that oozed sweet-smelling resin at their bases. [3-35-21]


He also observed on his way the forests and woodlands containing the noteworthy aloe plants, Takkola 
trees, and the nutmeg trees that are with fruits and aromatic, as well. [3-35-22]


Also seen are the flowers of Tamaala trees, shrubberies of pepper, and heaps of desiccating pearl-oysters 
along the seashore. [3-35-23]


Thus, he saw the peaking boulders, like that the reefs of corals, and like that also at the mountains 
that have golden and silvern crests. [3-35-24]


On seeing the delightful, serene, and marvellous cascades, and cities that are abundant in wealth and 
agricultural produce, and abundant with gemlike womenfolk, and that are replete with elephants, horses, 
and chariots, Ravana proceeded further. [3-35-25, 26a]


Ravana observed the delta adjacent to seacoast of that kingly ocean to be uniform and smooth, while 
the light air breezing in there is soft for touch, thus it looked heavenly. [3-35-26b, 27a]


There Ravana also saw a banyan tree which in sheen is like a black-cloud, and the branches of which 
are stretching all over for a hundred yojana-s in length, and on which sages made their abode for practising 
ascesis. [3-35-27b, 28a]


This is the tree on the branch of which once highly mighty Divine Eagle Garuda swooped to perch, clawing 
an elephant and a mammoth tortoise, for the purpose of dining them out on that tree-branch. [3-35-28b, 
29a]


While descending rapidly then that best bird among birds Garuda suddenly broke that tree's branch which 
is full with leaves, owing to the impact of his high impetuosity. [3-35-29b, 30a]


Adhering to that tree-branch there are eminent sages like, Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s, 
Aja-s, and even sages like Dhuumraa-s that thrive on fumes and smokes are there, and there they are 
collectively practising asceticism upside down while clasping branches with their legs. [3-35-30b, 31a]


For the sake of the grace of those sages Garuda took flight from that tree, grasping that broken tree-branch 
of a hundred yojana length along with those pendulous sages with his beak, and both of the elephant 
and tortoise with both of his claws. [3-35-31b, 32a]


That virtue-souled Garuda consumed the meat of his prays, namely the elephant and the giant tortoise 
with a single foot, and destroyed the province of tribesmen with the same broken tree branch, and thus 
that supreme bird Garuda gained an incomparable happiness in rescuing those great-sages. [3-35-32b, 
33]


When his valour has become twice as much with that happiness that heedful Garuda indeed resolved to 
bring ambrosia from heaven. [3-35-34]


Smashing the guard of iron-grid completely and crashing the unbreakable diamond -like strongroom in 
which the ambrosia is safeguarded, then Garuda carried off ambrosia from the palace of Indra. [3-35-35]


Ravana on his way saw such a banyan tree named as Subhadra which is a much sought after tree for assemblages 
of great sages, and which betokens the deeds of that best-winged Garuda. [3-35-36]


On going to the other side of the lord of rivers, namely ocean, Ravana saw a pleasing hermitage in the 
sacred and scenic interior of the forest. [3-35-37]


At that place Ravana saw the demon named Maareecha, wearing jute-clothes and black deerskin and tufts 
of hairs, and the one with regulated diet. [3-35-38]


That demon Maareecha welcomed the king Ravana and customarily entertained him catering all the offerings 
that are beyond the scope of humans. [3-35-39]


On personally offering meals and drinking water, and venerating him properly Maareecha spoke this sentence 
to Ravana which is connotative of significance. [3-35-40]


"Oh, king of the demons, is everything well with your Lanka? Oh, king, for what reason you have put 
in an appearance again, that too in a trice? [3-35-41]


When Maareecha spoke to him thus, that highly radiant and eloquent Ravana then afterwards spoke this 
sentence to Maareecha. [3-35-42]

In this way, Raghava-s on offering water oblations to Jataayu went southwestward in the forest and proceeded 
looking around for Seetha. [3-69-1]


On going in southwest direction, both the Ikshvaku-s wielding bows, arrows, and swords, have come about 
a pathway which is an off the beaten track. [3-69-2]


That pathway is thickly wrapped in and penned up with numerous trees, climber plants, and hedgerows 
from all over, thus that is jammed, blocked and horrid in its appearance. [3-69-3]


On taking up the southern direction, and on crossing over that highly horrendous and thick of the forest, 
both those spryly energetic brothers moved ahead, speedily. [3-69-4]


Thereafter, both the highly vigorous Raghava-s have entered the impassable Kraunca forest, on going 
three krosa-s from Janasthaana. [3-69-5]


Those two brothers who are disquieted by the abduction of Seetha are now agog to find her, and they 
intently explored that forest temporising there and there. That forest is evocative of a congeries of 
many a black-cloud, and it embodies numerous flowers on many a flowered tree, numerous flights of birds 
flitting over them, and numerous animals sprawling under them, and with them that forest is as though 
highly rejoiced everywhere. [3-69-6, 7]


Then, both the brothers on passing over that Kraunca forest and on going from there eastwardly on a 
three-krosha route, those sons of Dasharatha have seen a horrendous forest in between Kraunca forest 
and Matanga hermitage, which is overspread with various thicketed and impassable trees, and over-sprawled 
by numerous gigantic predators and vulturine birds, and on scrutinising such a forest everywhere, there 
they saw a cave in a mountain, which is abyssal, equal to infernal region, and ever enshrouded by gloom. 
[3-69-8. 9, 10]


On getting at that cave those manly-tigers have seen a demoness nearby that cave, who is massive in 
shape and misshapen in her face. [3-69-11]


Both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, have seen a demoness there, who is an inducer of horror to the 
dunderheaded dullards, traumatic in her acts and truculent in her appearance, pot-bellied, pierce-fanged, 
overblown, pachydermatous, head hair shaggy, body shape lumpy-bumpy, and she is going on eating massive 
beasts. [3-69-12, 13]


Drawing nigh of those valorous brothers who are journeying on their way, that demoness actually clung 
onto Lakshmana who is going ahead of his elder brother, saying, "come... let's romance..." [3-69-14]


Closeting Soumitri in her embrace she told him this sentence, "I am Ayomukhi, by my name... you won 
me by your heroic personality, by that way, none can win me over... thus, you alone are my lover... 
oh, hero, oh, my husband... you will romance with me on mountaintops, in rivers, and on sandy isles, 
till the end of this life..." So is the love prattle of that demoness Ayomukhi. [3-69-15, 16]


When said that way that enemy-suppressor Lakshmana became furious, and upraising his sword he sheared 
off her nose, one ear, and one of her breasts. [3-69-17]


When her nose and ear are cut off that demoness of hideous mien yelled highly in a high voice, and she 
rushed off as she had rushed in at Lakshmana. [3-69-18]


When she fled those two brothers who are the eliminators of the friends of their enemies, have travelled 
further into the forest and entered a dense area of that forest, with their spiritedness as their guiding 
force. [3-69-19]


Though Lakshmana is the one with preparedness, properness, and pureness and thus a highly fulgent one 
by his persona, he prayfully said this sentence to his brother Rama whose anima is radiantly fulgorous. 
[3-69-20]


"My left arm is strongly shuddering and my heart is as though distraught... and even undesirable forebodings 
are also bidding fair... [3-69-21]


"Oh, exalted brother, thereby you be at the ready by paying attention to my expedient words... these 
forebodings are indeed portending to me as if some hazard is immediately ensuing... [3-69-22]


"This eerily dreadful bird known to be Vanjulaka is loudly ululating as though presaging our triumph 
in any given conflict that may ensue..." So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-69-23]


When those two brothers are searching entire forest for Seetha in that way, they heard a boisterous 
brouhaha emanated as though to completely shatter down that forest. [3-69-24]


As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the forest, that forest's cacophony appeared to be unbearably 
filling up that forest.


As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the sky, that forest's cacophony appeared to be unbearably 
filling up that forest. [3-69-25]


But desiring to know the source of that noise that sword-wielder Rama has seen a gigantically giant-bodied 
and gigantesque-chested demon in a section of brushwood along with his younger brother Lakshmana. [3-69-26]


Then they both had to drew nigh of a waylaying demon Kabandha, who is situated frontally with an overgrown 
body, which is neckless, ergo headless, ergo mouth in paunch. [3-69-27]


That diabolical demon is peaking like a huge mountain, his hair is horripilate and thickset, and his 
gleam is like a dark cloud, and his sounding is like a thunder. [3-69-28]


Only one ochry eye blazing like the tongue of an inferno is there on his forehead, which forehead situated 
on his chest. That single eye with incisive and sharp-sight is broad beaming and wide angling, on which 
there are winglike eyelids. That monster is now licking his giant mouth that is stuffed with spearhead 
like fangs, as he has just finished a gobble, and the brothers had to drew nigh of such a demon. [3-69-29, 
30]


He is eating the highly brutal bears, lions, predators, and elephants, and he is outstretching both 
of his deadly arms, each of which is stretchable to a yojana distance, and the bothers neared such a 
demon. [3-69-31]


That demon stayed waylaying the pathway of both the brothers who chanced there, while he is catching 
bears, divers flights of birds, and numerous choicest animals of those and those herds, gripping them 
with both of his long-reaching hands and hauling towards his mouth at his paunch, or dropping them off 
if they are unpalatable, and the brothers reached nearby of such a demon. [3-69-32, 33a]


On travelling just a krosha distance, then they have seen Kabandha, whose body is colossal, and who 
is heinous and hideous, and who is like living trunk fenced by its shoulders and arms, and who by his 
physique is very deadly in appearance. [3-69-33b, 34]


He that overlong-armed Kabandha outstretching his overlong arms snatched both of the Raghava-s, keeping 
them side-by-side in his fists, and wringing them with his might. [3-69-35]


Though they are the grapplers with swords and brandishers of unerring bows, and though outblazing is 
their pneuma and outstanding is their dexterity, both of those great mighty brothers lost control and 
had to yield themselves to that demon when he captured and dragged them. [3-69-36]


In that situation, that valiant Rama, the legatee of Raghava-s, is not verily anguished owing to his 
courage, but Lakshmana is very much anguished, as if he is callow and in an unsheltered state, and he 
that younger brother of Raghava, namely Lakshmana, also dejectedly said this to Rama, the legatee of 
Raghava-s. [3-69-37, 38a]


"Oh, valiant brother, see me, who am out of control on my inner-self, and gone into the control of the 
demon... oh, Raghava, you leave me and get yourself released from the grip of the demon... [3-69-38b, 
39a]


"Indeed offer me as an offering to this quiddity, and you seek safety at your pleasure... and you will 
reach Vaidehi shortly... this is my belief... [3-69-39b, 40a]


"Oh, Kakutstha, on regaining the kingdom of our father and forefathers, and when enthroned, oh, Rama, 
it will be apt of you to reminisce me always..." So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-69-40b, 41a]


But when Lakshmana said that way, Rama said to Soumitri, "Fret not thyself, futilely... oh, brave one, 
your king of persons will not get dismayed, futilely... [3-69-41b, 42a]


In the meantime, that ruthless, log-armed, fiercest demon Kabandha thunderously asked those brothers, 
Rama and Lakshmana. [3-69-42b, 43a]


"Who are you two? Your shoulders are akin to the bull-humps, and you are shouldering longbows and brandishing 
broad swords, how have you come about this province? For god's sake, I come across my most dainty morsel... 
[3-69-43b, 44a]


"What business you have here, and for which reason you have come here... you chanced for me who am sitting 
here and painfully ravenous... [3-69-44b, 45a]


"Though you are with arrows, bows and swords, and though you are like bulls with sharp horns ready to 
gore... but they are all a waste, as your life has readily become ungainful on reaching nigh of my sight 
and arms..." So said Kabandha, in his arrogant tone. [3-69-45b, 46a]


On hearing that sentence of that vile-souled Kabandha, Rama said this to Lakshmana with a wilted face. 
[3-69-46b, 47a]


"Oh, truth-valiant Lakshmana, now coming to pass is a worst catastrophe, after a worse catastrophe, 
after a catastrophe...namely, the expiration at the hands of this demon presently, and the expropriation 
of Seetha previously, and the expulsion from kingship, still previously... nonetheless, without coming 
across that ladylove, this disastrous despair of ending our lives is coming about... [3-69-47b, 48a]


"Oh, Lakshmana, the efficacy of Time is preponderant and proportional among all beings... oh, manly-tiger, 
why generalisation... see, as to how yourself and even myself are entangled in the tangles of life, 
even though we assert ourselves to be brave and best... [3-69-48b, 49a]


Oh, Lakshmana, to show its impact on each and every being Time, or God is unencumbered and unremitting... 
may he be a brave one or a brawny one... or, may they be those that have perfected their missilery... 
when Time chances their nigh, they have to founder... as with a sandy levee... [3-69-49b, 50]


Rama being the son of Dasharatha is an indomitable one, besides, a firmly and factually valorous one, 
by which he earned a great renown, and he on telling thus, and on looking over that recalcitrantly vengeful 
Soumitri, then Rama readied himself by his own steadied thinking. [3-69-51]

			This chapter is removed from the critical edition and retained by traditional versions There

			Some more details are given in the endnote. Akampana's character inevitably has continuity 
			in the war scene at the end.


Then on going hurriedly from Janasthaana and on speedily entering Lanka Akampana spoke these words to 
Ravana. [3-31-1]


"Oh, king, many demons positioned in Janasthaana are killed, Khara is also killed in war, and somehow 
I have come here. [3-31-2]


Thus said, then that ten-faced Ravana is infuriated with bloodshot eyes, and as though to burn down 
whole world with his radiance he spoke this to Akampana. [3-31-3]


"Who is that dead-and-gone that has destroyed my indomitable Janasthaana? Who is it that has indeed 
opted for no recourse in all of the worlds? [3-31-4]


"Evoking indignation in me it is really impossible for Indra to be happy; even for Kubera - no; for 
Yama - no; why them, even Vishnu cannot be happy. [3-31-5]


"I am the End-Time for the Time-god himself, I will burn down the Fire-god, and I am capable of conjoining 
Death with the virtue of deathliness. [3-31-6]


"If I am enraged I will incinerate Sun-god or Fire-god just with my radiance, I will halt even the impetuosity 
of Wind-god with that of mine." Thus Ravana said about himself. [3-31-7]


Akampana with his palms adjoined and voice hesitant with fear sought for the clemency of that decahedral 
demon Ravana who is enraged in that way. [3-31-8]


When the supremo of demons Dasha-griiva pardoned him then that Akampana spoke these words, unfalteringly 
and trustfully. [3-31-9]


"He is a youth whose shoulders are mighty, arms round and lengthy, built like that a lion, who is the 
son of Dasharatha and known as Rama. [3-31-10]


"He is blue-black in complexion, a highly renowned one with matchless might and valour, a magnificent 
one such as he is he slew Duushana along with Khara in Janasthaana." [3-31-11]


On hearing the words of Akampana, the chief of demons Ravana, spoke these words hissing like a kingly 
serpent. [3-31-12]


"The question is whether that Rama arrived at Janasthaana associated with Indra and along with all of 
the immortal gods? Oh, Akampana, speak about it. [3-31-13]


Akampana again detailed about the might and valour of that great souled Rama on hearing that sentence 
of Ravana. [3-31-14]


"Rama means someone who is highly resplendent, an ablest archer among all archers, one who is endowed 
with divine missiles and divine attributes, and he is the one who conducts warfare with a supreme conduct. 
[3-31-15]


"And a mighty one with redly eyes and drumbeat like voice, and whose face is shiny like the full-moon 
is Rama's selfsame younger brother known as Lakshmana. [3-31-16]


"Alike the wind associating with fire this Lakshmana is associated with that glorious and nonpareil 
prince Rama, and that firestorm, namely Rama, destroyed Janasthaana. [3-31-17]


"They are not any great souled gods or any heavenly beings as such, hence there is no need to doubt 
about it. Rama unloosened his gold-finned and feather-winged arrows, which on becoming five-faced serpents 
started consuming the demons. [3-31-18]


"To whichever nook those demons smitten by fear of those serpent-like are fleeing, they have seeing 
Rama alone standing afore them in that corner, and oh, merited king Ravana, in this way your Janasthaana 
is totally ruined by that Rama. [3-31-19b, 20] [3-31-19]


On hearing the words of Akampana Ravana said these words, "I will to go to Janasthaana to kill Rama 
along with Lakshmana." [3-31-21]


When Ravana said so then Akampana said these words in reply, " listen, oh, king, what all has happened, 
and of what in actuality is Rama's spirit and grit. [3-31-22]


"Rama, the highly renolwned, is invincible just by braving against him, for that Rama in fury can stall 
the onrush of a plethoric river with his arrows. [3-31-23]


"That magnificent Rama can collapse even the firmament along with its starlets, stars and planets, and 
he even can elevate the earth if it were to collapse. [3-31-24]


"On breaching the shoreline of the ocean with his arrows that lord Rama can deluge worlds, and he can 
stem the tide of turbulent ocean, or can even stall the agent of that turbulence, namely the wind. [3-31-25]


"That great valorous and the ablest among humans is capable to destroy all the worlds with his valour, 
and even capable of creating the people again.


Or, again dissolving all the worlds into himself, that great contemplator who transcends all is even 
capable of creating the creation again from out of him. [3-31-26]


"Oh, Dashagriiva, it is impossible to conquer that Rama in war for your, either singly or along with 
the hosts of the demon-supporters of yours, as one heaven cannot be won by many sinners. [3-31-27]


"I do not think that he is killable even for all god and demons, and this is the idea to kill him, and 
to this you may listen attentively. [3-31-28]


"An excellent woman in the world is there, a youthful one with symmetrical limbs, a jewel-like lady 
adorned with jewellery, that slender-waisted one who is known as Seetha is his wife. [3-31-29]


"No goddess can be likened to that mature lady; a gandharva female - no; a apsara female - no; a pannaga 
female -no, then how can there be a woman of her like? [3-31-30]


"You forcefully abduct his wife when she is in solitude, and indeed Rama will not exist reft of Seetha." 
Akampana advised Ravana in this way. [3-31-31]


The chief of demons Ravana favouring that idea thought of it and that mighty armed Ravana then spoke 
to Akampana. [3-31-32]


"Agreed! I wish to go alone early in the morning with a charioteer and I delightfully wish to lead Vaidehi 
into the elegant city Lanka." Ravana declared that way. [3-31-33]


Saying so Ravana journeyed in a chariot that is yoked with mule-like horses, and that has the dazzling 
of the sun, whereby all the directions are made to glitter. [3-31-34]


That opalescent chariot of the lord of demons while speedily progressing through starry way shone forth 
as if it is the moon in clouds. [3-31-35]


On going to the hermitage of Maareecha which is at a distant place Maareecha the son of Tataka received 
Ravana and venerated that king of demons with sweetmeats and savouries that are unavailable to humans. 
[3-31-36]


Offering proper seat and water for washing feet and hands Maareecha personally attended Ravana and spoke 
to him this sentence that is worded meaningfully. [3-31-37]


"Oh, king and supremo of demons, I am anxious to know whether everything safe and secure to the inhabitants 
of your kingdom, for I am not in the know of the reason by which now you have come here rushingly. [3-31-38]


When Maareecha said so to him that greatly radiant one who is a sententious speaker that Ravana thereafter 
spoke this sentence. [3-31-39]


"Oh, sire, Rama who is indefatigable in warring has ruined my security stationed at Janasthaana, and 
in war he even brought down all of Janasthaana which is undefeatable so far, such as I am, to me you 
have to render friendly help in kidnapping Rama's wife." [3-31-40]


On hearing the words of that chief of demons, Maareecha spoke these words, "who broached the subject 
of Seetha with you, an enemy in the fakery of a friend? Oh, tigerly demon, who is that censurable one 
that is unhappy with you, since he is giving such a self-ruinous advise? [3-31-42]


" 'Seetha may be brought to Lanka...' who said it, say him to me, who is that one desiring to cut off 
the prominence of all the demons in all worlds in saying so?


"Who is desirous of getting a zenithal demon ruling all the three worlds to be cut-off when he said 
that Seetha shall be brought to Lanka?


"Who is saying that Seetha is to be brought to Lanka with a desire to get your apogeal ten-heads that 
are prominent among all the clansmen of demons to be cut-off? [3-31-43]


"Also, he who has motivated you in this way is an undoubted enemy of yours, for he wanted to extricate 
the fangs of a snake from its mouth, of course, through you. [3-31-44]


"By whom and by which purpose of his you are made to blunder upon this awry path, oh, king, it is as 
good as his hitting hard on your head while you are fast asleep. [3-31-45]


"Oh, Ravana, it will be unbefitting to raise an eye to see Rama in war, who will be then like a majestic 
elephant that has an impeccable dynasty and bloodline as its mammoth trunk, personal radiance as its 
indomitable might, very firm pair of arms as its pernicious tusks, more so, who will be with the redolence 
of the irrepressible lineage of Raghava-s. [3-31-46]


"To be in the midst of war itself is the fury of that lion called Rama, by which that lion raises its 
tail touching the back of its trunk, that lion is all-inclusive with forelegs, paws, and claws that 
are included in arrows, while its fangs are swords, and it is the killer of the deer called the expert 
killer-demons, and mind you, do not dare to rouse that sleeping man-lion. [3-31-47]


"His bow is crocodilian, his shoulder-speed is quagmire, his arrows are tidal, and the great immensity 
of his war itself is a tideland, and oh, king of demons, it is inapt of you to slide down into the much-ghoulish 
mouth of that abyssal ocean, called Rama. [3-31-48]


"Oh, lord of Lanka, be appeased towards Rama, be quietened and gently proceed to Lanka. You take delight 
in your wives, and let Rama be delighting with wife in forests." Thus Mareecha spoke to Ravana. [3-31-49]


When thus said by Maareecha that ten faced Ravana returned to his city Lanka and entered his best house 
and home. [3-31-50]

Rama travelled ahead while the glorious Seetha in middle, and wielding bow Lakshmana followed them on 
the rear. [4-11-1]


They proceeded while seeing diverse mountain terraces, forests, and diversely enchanting rivers too, 
along with Seetha. [4-11-2]


Beholding the rivers that have water-birds like saarasa, chakravaaka that move on their sandbanks, and 
also the lakes that contain lotuses and water born birds, they moved on. [4-11-3]


The moved on watching spotted deer banded in herds, the wild boars, large horned buffaloes maddened 
in virility, and the ruttish elephants rending trees like their enemies. [4-11-4]


On going far on their way, and when the sun is dangling in the western skiy, together they saw a charming 
lake of one yojana width fully overloaded with red and white lotuses, overspread with sporting elephants, 
and over-flurried with waterfowls like saarasa birds, kaadamba birds, swans and with others kinds too. 
[4-11-5, 6]


Out of the tranquil and enchanting waters of that lake audible are the melodies of singing and musical 
instruments, but none is visible. [4-11-7]


Then Rama and also Lakshmana, the great charioteer, inquisitively started to ask the Sage named Dharmabhrita 
about it. [4-11-8]


"On hearing this greatly amazing music from lake, oh, great saint, intensive inquisitiveness is created 
in all of us, why this, please tell us clearly about it." Thus Rama asked. [4-11-9]


Thus said by that Raghava then that virtuous sage quickly started to tell about the efficacy of that 
lake. [4-11-10]


"Oh, Rama, this is an all-time lake built by the ascetic power of the sage Mandakarni, known as Five 
Apsara Lake. [4-11-11]


"He that great saint Mandakarni practiced rigorous ascesis for ten thousand years staying in the waters 
of the lake, and consuming air alone. [4-11-12]


"Then all the gods are worried and met together with Fire-god at the helm of affairs, and they all conversed 
among themselves. [4-11-13]


"This sage is praying for someone's place among us," thus all of those heaven-dwellers are perturbed 
at heart. [4-11-14]


"Then all gods assigned five important Apsara-s, the celestial courtesans, whose shine is like the sprint 
of the lightning, to effectuate hindrance in that sage's ascesis. [4-11-15]


Then those five celestial beauties have led that sage astray who discerned the nature of this and the 
other world, or good and bad, or the nature of Absolute-Soul and Body- bound Soul, towards the passional 
restraint by, as though to achieve god's task.


"Also thus, those five celestial apsara-s attained wifehood of that sage, and for them he built a house 
in there, concealed inside that lake. [4-11-17]


"While those five celestial apsara-s are living in there, they are gratifying that sage according to 
his delight as youthfulness came upon that sage owing to his power of asceticism. [4-11-18]


"These musical sounds we hear are emerging out as played on their instruments, mingled with the tinkling 
of their ornaments, and mixed with their delightful singing of melodies." So said sage Dharmabhrita 
to Rama. [4-11-19]


That highly renowned Raghava together with his brother acknowledged the sage Dharmabhrita's account, 
exclaiming it as "amazing is this..." [4-11-20]


While saying thus Raghava has seen a cluster of hermitages nearby, encircled with sacred grass, jute 
cloths, and even encompassed with Vedic solemness, and he entered that hermitage along with Seetha and 
Lakshmana. [4-11-21, 22a]


Rama happily stayed in that august cluster of hermitages duly venerated by those great saints for sometime, 
and then that expert in great missiles Rama went to the hermitages of those sages with whom he stayed 
earlier, for another round. [4-11-22, 23, 24a]


Rama stayed there for nearly ten months at some place, elsewhere for one year, at somewhere else for 
four months, and for five, and six months at elsewhere, even at somewhere else for more than a month, 
and for more than one and half months elsewhere. [4-11-24, 25, 26a]


While Raghava stayed comfortably taking delight in those hermitages of sages, indeed ten years have 
smoothly elapsed. [4-11-26b, 27a]


Thus that virtue-knowing glorious Rama on going around those hermitages along with Seetha indeed went 
to the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna again. [4-11-27b, 28a]


On coming at that hermitage that enemy destroyer is adored by sages, and he resided there for some time. 
[4-11-28b, 29a]


Then on one day while staying in that hermitage Rama submissively said this to that sage Suteekshna 
who is sitting nearby. [4-11-29b, 30a]


"I have always heard through the narratives narrated by other sages that the godly and eminent sage 
Agastya is residing in this forest. [4-11-30b, 31a]


"But due to the vastness of this forest I have not known that place, where is the pious hermitage of 
that astute sage? [4-11-31b, 32a]


"I wish to approach that sage seeking that godly sage's graciousness, along with my brother and Seetha 
to venerate him. [4-11-32b, 33a]


"Can I personally propitiate that supreme sage -- is my high ambition, and it is recurrent in my heart." 
So said Rama to Suteekshna. [4-11-33b, 34a]


Sage Suteekshna on hearing that particular request of that virtue-minded Rama is gladdened and said 
this to him. [4-11-34b, 35a]


"Oh, Raghava, even I wished to say this to you, that you may approach Agastya along with Lakshmana and 
Seetha. [4-1-35b, 36a]


"But providentially you alone raised this topic with me, Rama, I will tell you where that great sage 
Agastya is. [4-11-36b, 37a]


"On your going four yojana-s from this hermitage, oh, dear Rama, there is the great and glorious hermitage 
of Agastya's brother on the southern side. [4-11-37b, c]


"That hermitage is there on a plateau in a spectacular place of that forest which is adorned with many 
flowers and fruits, thickets of long pepper, and reechoed with the callings of various birds. [4-11-38]


"There are diverse lakes that are receptacles for tranquil waters, that are teeming with swans and partridges, 
beautified with ruddy geese, and Rama staying there for a night you may proceed in the next morning. 
[4-11-39, 40a]


"On going one yojana beyond, taking the southward course on the side of the forest clump you will find 
Agastya's hermitage. [4-11-40b, 41a]


"Seetha and Lakshmana will enjoy those woodlands adorned with diverse pleasant trees, as the woodlands 
abounding with diverse trees will naturally be delightful, isn't it. [4-11-41b, 42]


"If your mind is made up to see that great sage Agastya, oh, great ingenious Rama, resolve your thinking 
in going only today." So said Sage Suteekshna to Rama. [4-11-43]


On listening that which is said by the sage, Rama revered that sage along with his brother, and then 
he journeyed with Seetha and his follower Lakshmana aiming to reach Agastya. [4-11-44]


While viewing beautiful forests, cloud-like mountains, lakes, and rivers that are flowing following 
the pathways, Rama happily journeyed on the pathway indicated by sage Suteekshna, then he gladly spoke 
this sentence to Lakshmana. [4-11-45, 46]


"Definitely this alone appears to be the hermitage of Sage Agastya's brother, one with great soul and 
pious deeds. [4-11-47]


"As how thousands of trees are bowing under the weight of flowers and fruit on the pathway, thereby 
I perceive it to be the hermitage of Agastya's bother. [4-11-48]


"Upraised by the wind the sour-smell of pippali fruits is suddenly coming closer from the forest. [4-11-49]


"Here and there visible are the well heaped heaps of firewood, and all over appearing is the sacred 
grass snipped at its top and gemlike in its tinge. [4-11-50]


"From inside the hermitage in the midst of this forest the vertex of smoke from ritual fire is clearly 
visible as high as the vertex of a black rainy cloud. [4-11-51]


"On performing bathing in sacred streams the Brahmans are making flower offerings to gods, called
<font color="#B3003A">puSpa bali</font>, with the flowers that are personally collected by them. [4-11-52]


"Thus by the words of Sage Suteekshna as I have heard, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this hermitage shall definitely 
be that of Sage Agastya's brother. [4-11-53]


"Whose brother is Sage Agastya with meritorious deeds, who wishing well-being of the world controlled 
death by his efficacy, and who made this southern region a liveable region, this must be the hermitage 
of such a sage, such Agatya's brother. [4-11-54]


"Once upon a time verily cruel demon brothers Vaataapi and Ilvala were here together, and they the dreadful 
demons, they say, used to be Bhraman-killers. [4-11-55]


"Disguising in Bhraman's semblance and speaking sophisticatedly that Ilvala used to invite Brahmans 
for the purpose of obsequial ceremonies, where Brahman are fed after usual ceremony to appeases their 
manes. [4-11-56]


Then Ilvala used to make his brother Vaataapi into a ram, perfect that ram's meat into deliciously cooked 
food, and used to feed Brahmans according to obsequial rites and deeds. [4-11-57]


"When those Brahmans are surfeited with that ram's meat, then Ilvala used to shout loudly, "oh, Vaataapi, 
you may come out." [4-11-58]


"Then on listening his brother's words Vaataapi used to lunge out bleating like a ram, tearing and rending 
the bodies of those Brahmans. [4-11-59]


"This way they the guise changing demons always ruined thousands of Brahmans together, greedy for raw-flesh 
as they are. [4-11-60]


"Then by Sage Agastya, whom gods have prayed to end this demonic menace, and whom demon Ilvala invited 
to feast during obsequial rites, he that Agastya having relished the fiendish demon in the form of ram, 
they say, had finished him off. [4-11-61]


"Then Ilvala while giving lateral hand wash into the palms of Agastya entered in the routine conversation 
of obsequies asking, "Is this rite fulfilled..." and he furthered it in calling his brother to come 
out. [4-11-62]


Then that wise and eminent sage Agastya spoke mockingly to Ilvala who is conversing that way to his 
brother to come out. [4-11-63]


"Where is the energy for that ram shaped demon brother of yours to come out as I digested and sent him 
to the hellish residence of Terminator. [4-11-64]


"Then on hearing the words of sage Agastya affirming brother's demise, that night-walking demon furiously 
commenced to assault the sage. [4-11-65]


"When that demon rushed towards that best Bhraman to kill, he that sage glowing with his own refulgence 
burnt him down just by his flame-like eyes and doomed him to death. [4-11-66]


"This hermitage embellishing with lake and woods belongs to the brother of Sage Agastya who has done 
this impossible deed just by his compassion towards Brahmans." So said Rama to Lakshmana and Seetha 
about Agastya. [4-11-67]


While Rama narrated that way to Lakshmana sun went into dusk and the vesperal time came close of him. 
[4-11-68]


Worshipping sunset along with brother as per custom, Rama entered that hermitage and greeted that sage. 
[4-11-69]


Raghava spent one night there when that sage received him well and when they dined on tubers and fruits. 
[4-11-70]


Raghava spent that night there and when sun rose in solar orbit he took leave of the brother of Sage 
Agastya saying the following. [4-11-71]


"Oh, godly sage, we stayed in the night comfortably, I now make an obeisance and bid farewell to you, 
as I wish to proceed to see your mentor and elder brother Agastya. [4-11-72]


When the brother of Agastya said, "you may go," Rama the legatee of Raghu journeyed on the pathways 
as directed by Suteekshna, and on observing those woodlands. [4-11-73]


On observing the wild grass that grows on its own giving wild grain, Jack-fruit trees, sala trees, Ashoka 
trees, lemons trees, saplings of bilva trees and also madhuka and bilva trees he journeyed. [4-11-74]


Rama has seen hundreds of flowered forest trees that are battered by the trunks of elephants, that are 
adorned with monkeys, reverberated by hundreds of lusty bird folks, and that are enriched by the flowered 
climbers whorled around them. [4-11-75, 76]


Then the lotus-eyed Rama said this to his follower Lakshmana who is a valiant and glory-enriching one 
and who is near at hand. [4-11-77]


"As to how the trees are appearing with velvety leaves, and as to how the animals and birds appear unwearied, 
thus gauging by this it appears that the hermitage of that contemplative soul Agastya is situated not 
very far from here. [4-11-78]


"He who by his own deed is renowned in the world as Agastya, the stopper of mountain, it appears to 
be his hermitage that alleviates the weary of wearied ones. [4-11-79]


"The forest nearby this hermitage is overrun by huge smoke from altars of fire, overstuffed with the 
garlands of jute cloth, overcrowded with the herds of peaceful deer, and also overloaded with sonority 
of the birds. [4-11-80]


"He who impeding death by his yogic might and wishing well-being for worlds made this southern extent 
a liveable province by his pious deeds, his hermitage is this. [4-11-81]


"Under whose influence the demons behold this southern quarter appallingly, and they do not even venture 
to live here, such a sage Agastya's hermitage is this. [4-11-82]


"And from when that pious deeded Agastya took possession of this quarter, from then on the night walkers 
are calmed down and remained without feud. [4-11-83]


"This very worthy southern quarter is known in the name of that godly saint Agastya and this remained 
unattackable to the demons with cruel deeds. [4-11-84]


"Complying which sage's directive Mt. Vindhya ceased to heighten in order not to obstruct the path of 
the sun, such sage's hermitage is this who is renowned in the world by his deeds and whose longevity 
is inestimable, hence this glorious hermitage is adored by well-behaved animals and humans as well. 
[4-11-85, 86]


"He that gentle sage who is always interested in the respect of sagacious ones is thus an esteemed one 
in the world, and for us when we approach him he accords beneficence. [4-11-87]


"Oh, adept Lakshmana, I wish to worship that great saint Agastya therein that hermitage, and oh, gentle 
one, I think of living the remainder of forest living here only. [4-11-88]


"There gods with gandharva-s, siddha-s, exalted sages will be worshipping Agastya who is self-regulating 
self-disciplinary. [4-11-89]


"There no liar can live, nor a savage, nor even a deceiver, nor a man-torturer, nor one with sinful 
behaviour, for that sage is of that nature. [4-11-90]


"There the gods, celestials, reptiles, birds live together wishing to worship the Absolute with self-discipline. 
[4-11-91]


"There the blest and great souls of accomplished ascesis rode to heavens by aircrafts similar to sun 
in resplendence, on relinquishing their mortal bodies here and on obtaining new bodies. [4-11-92]


"There gods will endow the state of celestials or immortals, or many realms of divine living to those 
auspicious beings that worship them. [4-11-93]


"We arrived at the threshold of the hermitage, oh, Soumitri, you enter firstly and submit to Sage Agastya 
about my arrival at this place along with Seetha. [4-11-94]

A pitiable one, such as he is, he spoke to Lakshmana in a pitiable voice,
"Lakshmana, go quickly to River Godavari and find out whether Seetha has gone to Godavari to fetch
lotuses..." [3-64-1, 2a]


When Rama said thus to him Lakshmana again went to the charming River Godavari
quickening his pace. [3-64-2b, 3a]


Searching at many declivities which River Godavari has on its banks Lakshmana said
to Rama, "I do not espy her at ghats, declivities of riverbanks, and she is not replying though I
shouted for her. [3-64-3b, 4a]


"In fact, oh, Rama, to which place she that neutraliser of nervousness, namely
Vaidehi, has got round to, or where that frailty is, that place is really incomprehensible to me...
[3-64-4b, 5a]


Rama who is already stupefied by anguish is now despaired on listening Lakshmana's
words and he personally went straight to River Godavari, and staying nearby that river Rama shouted
in this way, "Seetha... where are you?" [3-64-5b, 6]


The forest creatures which were asked earlier have not said to Rama that a
deservedly destructible demagogue of demons has divested him of Seetha, likewise now River Godavari
which is now being asked has not informed Rama about Seetha. [3-64-7]


Though the woeful Rama has asked her, and even though all the georgic beings
impelled her to inform Rama the fact about his ladylove, River Godavari then remained mouthless
about Seetha. [3-64-8]


She that River Godavari has not informed Rama about Vaidehi just out of fear on
recalling the mien and manoeuvres of malefic-minded Ravana, lest Ravana may drain her away.
[3-64-9]


Rama who is already in a rundown condition owing to the non-appearance of Seetha, is
further rendered as a hopeless being by River Godavari in the matter of his catching a glimpse of
Seetha, and such a Rama spoke to Saumitri. [3-64-10]


"Oh, kind Lakshmana, this Godavari is talking to me anything but a reply. In the
absence of Vaidehi, oh Lakshmana, really what is that unpleasant word I have to say to Vaidehi's
father king Janaka, also thus to Vaidehi's mother-in-law and my mother Kausalya, when I meet them!
[3-64-11, 12a]


"Which Vaidehi is the remover of all my sadness who am a destitute of kingdom and
surviving in forests on forest produce, such as she is, where has she gone, really! [3-64-12b,
13a]


"Though I am distanced from my relatives I deemed that princess Seetha alone would
be an evermore relative of mine. But now when that princess alone is unseen I deem that my
sleepless nights would be lengthy. [3-64-13b, 14a]


"I will search all these places of Godavari, Janasthaana and this mountain with many
rapids, perhaps Seetha may be available somewhere. [3-64-14b, 15a]


"Now all these burly animals are repeatedly looking at me as though to speak to me,
oh, brave Lakshmana, this I reckon with their body language as it were. [3-64-15b, 16a]


But on seeing them pryingly that tigerly-man Raghava has indeed asked them at once
with a voice stifled with tears, "where is Seetha?" [3-64-16b, 17a]


When that best king has asked, those animals rose to their feet in a trice and
facing themselves southward showed skyward with their snouts. And while running in the direction in
which Maithili is taken away they are stopping to look back at that lord of people, Rama. Thus they
are repeatedly running, stopping and staring at Rama. [3-64-17b, 18, 19a]


By which reason those animals are going in a southerly course on a southerly
terrain, and stopping to peer at Rama, and again clamorously adopting the very same southerly
course, Lakshmana ascertained that reason. [3-64-19b, 20a]


On noticing the lingua franca and even the lingua persona of those animals, that
imaginative Lakshmana spoke to his elder brother, alike a striver striving hard for some
information. [3-64-20b, 21a]


"Oh, godly brother, when you have asked these animals, 'where is Seetha,' they
quickly rose to their feet, and as to how they are showing the track on the ground and the southern
direction as well, thereby we may, for sure, go south-westward to know whether there is some
information about her, or else, even that noble lady herself may be available there..." [3-64-21a,
22, 23a]


On saying "Yes!" to Lakshmana that illustrious Rama of Kakutstha sallied forth to
southern direction followed by Lakshmana, scrutinising the earth on his walkway. [3-64-23b,
24a]


Those two brothers who are proceeding while discussing among themselves have seen
the walkway bestrewn with flowers fallen from a person. [3-64-24b, 25a]


That valiant Rama who is anguished to see the drizzle of flowers fallen on the
surface of earth spoke this word to Lakshmana who is equally anguished. [3-64-25b, 26a]


"I recognise these flowers that are fallen here, oh, Lakshmana. In forest I gave
them to Vaidehi and she tucked these very flowers in her bun. [3-64-26b, 27a]


"These flowers are carefully safeguarded by the sun, as they are unwithered yet, by
air as they are unswept by it, and by the glorious earth, as they are unspoilt by that, thus I deem
that these naturals, sun, air, and earth are really proffering a helping hand to me. [3-64-27b,
28a]


On saying thus to best one among men Lakshmana, that virtue-souled and dextrous Rama
asked the mountain that is uproarious with rapids. [3-64-28b, 29a]


"Oh, lord among the earth-bolstered mountains, have you somehow seen a beauty by all
her limbs, foregone by me in beautiful woodlands?" [3-64-29b, 30a]


<font color="#B3003A">Reply of mountain to Rama:</font>"Oh, lordly bolsterer of
earth, lord Rama, I have somehow seen a beauty by all her limbs, foregone by you in beautiful
woodlands.'


Because his question is unanswered he is enraged as with a lion enraging at a puny
animal, and then he spoke to the mountain, "show me that golden tinged, golden limbed Seetha, oh,
mountain, no sooner than I devastate all your apices, apiece..." [3-64-30b, 31]


When Rama spoke to the mountain in this way, that mountain echoed as if it is
revealing Seetha, but actually it has not revealed Seetha to Raghava. [3-64-32]


Then Rama of Dasharatha said to the hefty mountain, "When the infernos of my arrows
will burn you down completely and when you will be pared down ashes, you shall be grassless,
treeless and tender-leafless, and thus you become a meritless mountain... hence, show Seetha before
becoming so... [3-64-33, 34a]


"Lakshmana, if this River Godavari is not going to tell me immediately about that
moonshine-faced Seetha, now I will dry her up... [3-64-34b, 35a]


This way when Rama is highly infuriated and who appeared to burn down anything just
with his eyes, then he has seen on the ground gigantic footprints of a demon, and the footprints of
Vaidehi, who appeared to have run fearfully here and there in a helter-skelter manner expecting the
arrival of Rama, and which footprints are heavily trodden by a demon who followed her. [3-64-35b,
36, 37a]


On scrutinising the overly trodden footprints of Seetha and the demon, and a broken
bow, broken quiver, and broken and variously bestrewn chariot also, then Rama became baffle-hearted
and said to his dear brother Lakshmana. [3-64-37b, 38]


"See Lakshmana, many beads of jewellery and many bits of garlands of Vaidehi have
indeed fallen down, and oh, Soumitri, they are strewn around... [3-64-39]


"Also the surface of the earth is everywhere interspersed with big and small blood
drops that are akin to golden droplets, you see them Saumitri... [3-64-40]


"I think Lakshmana, guise changing demons would have ripped and rived Vaidehi, or
divided her into pieces, or they might have gluttonised her. [3-64-41]


"A deadly clash has occurred here, Soumitri, while two demons were clashing between
themselves on account of Vaidehi... [3-64-42]


"Oh, gentle Lakshmana, studded with pearls and gems this great bow of someone is
beautifully decorated, but it is fragmented and fallen to earth. Oh, dear boy, Lakshmana, this bow
may perhaps belong to demons, or else to gods... [3-64-43, 44a]


"Studded with lapis gem beads this golden armour of someone is similar to the rising
sun in its shine, but it is splintered and fallen to earth... [3-64-44b, 45a]


"This hundred-spoked regal-parasol of someone is embellished with divine festoons,
but oh, gentle Lakshmana, its central-shaft is wrecked and it is felled to earth... [3-64-45b,
46a]


"These ghost-faced mules with golden breastplates are macabre in form and massive in
frame, but they are hewed down in war, whose are they, either... [3-64-46b, 47a]


"Somebody's combat-chariot is irradiant and similar in shine to the flaring fire
with a war-pennon, but it is broken and battered down, as well... [3-64-47b, 48a]


"These frightful looking arrows of somebody are gilded and they are as much as a
chariot's axle in their thickness, but their arrowheads are shred and they are manifoldly shredded
and strewn around... [3-64-48, 49a]


"Lakshmana, you see these two quivers packed with arrows are completely shattered,
and the charioteer is drop dead with whip and bridles still in his hands... whose charioteer he
might be! [3-64-49b, 50a]


Lakshmana, you see... these two armours, one belonging to the combatant from this
chariot [that is ripped off by Jataayu and fallen from the body of Ravana,] and the other belonging
to this charioteer, both are encrusted fully with arrows [when Jataayu winnowed the very same
arrows shot by Ravana with both of his wings and thus shot them back,] thus the two armours are
completely shattered... and the charioteer is drop dead with whip and bridles in his hand... either
he... whose is he... and where is the presiding combatant of this chariot....


"Evidently this is the modus operandi of someone who is a male demon, and you see
how my animosity has become hundredfold to eradicate them... [3-64-50b, 51a]


"The highly stony-hearted demons that are guise-changers by their wish have either
abducted, or killed or gluttonised saintly Seetha... but, they say that rectitude saves such
saintly persons... yet that rectitude has not saved Seetha while she is being abducted in great
forest... [3-64-51b, 52]


"Whether Vaidehi is taken away or taken in by some unknown being, oh, gentle
Lakshmana, then who are the gods who can possibly be benignant to me in this world... [3-64-53]


"Lakshmana, someone, even if He were a Creator of Worlds, or an Omnipotent, if He
were to be lenient at heart or in His actions, He will be disrespected by all beings, owing to the
unenlightenment of those beings... [3-64-54]


"I who am mellowly, magnanimous, merciful and yoked only to the wellbeing of all
worlds, such as I am, all of the heavenly gods deem me as non-Omnipotent... it is definite...
[3-64-55]


"Have you seen Lakshmana how merits like mercifulness, magnanimity and the like are
inverted to become demerits on getting at me, thus I am unmerited in forgoing Seetha. As such, as
with the sizzle of sun uprisen quelling all the moonshine, now you may see as to how my irradiance
radiates quelling all the merits like softness and fairness for the nonentity of all beings
proactive to demons, inclusive of demons. [3-64-56, 57]


"Oh, Lakshmana, will the yaksha-s be comfortable now, no; gandharva-s - no; monsters
- no; demons - no; either kinnaraa-s or humans - no, none can be comfortable henceforth...
[3-64-58]


"Now the welkin will be packed with my arrows and missiles, and I will render it as
an impassable sphere for the treaders in the triad of worlds... [3-64-59]


"I will make the triad of worlds quiescent by completely blockading all the
planetary bodies. The night-maker moon will be barricaded, aurae of fire, air and sun will be
devastated, and then everything will be overcast with darkness. Mountaintops will be completely
pulverised, water receptacles will be dried out, and trees, creeping-plants and shrubberies will be
destroyed, and oceans depleted, thus I will bring the triad of the worlds to nought, relative to
the task of Time in extinguishing an era... [3-64-60, 61, 62a]


"If the gods are not going to safely restore Seetha to me, oh, Soumitri, they can
see what my blitzkrieg is, at this very moment... [3-64-62b, 63a]


"All beings cannot fly high in the sky, oh, Lakshmana, as there will be a labyrinth
of my arrows released from my bowstring, minus an intercolumniation... [3-64-63b, 64a]


"Bombarded with my iron-shafts this world will be put to disorderliness, Lakshmana,
you may now witness how the animals and birds will be dazed and devastated... [3-64-64b, 65a]


"Because of Maithili I will render this mortal world de-demonical, de-phantasmal by
force-stretching my unstoppable arrows up to my ears to release them forcefully... [3-64-65b,
66a]


"Let the gods witness now the impact of the blaze-crested, thoroughgoing arrows of
mine, projected by my wrath and released by my irascibility... [3-64-66b, 67a]


"That being so, when the triad of worlds is completely ruined by my anger will there
be gods, no; demons - no; phantoms - no, none can survive... [3-64-67b, 68a]


"Whatever worlds of gods, or monsters, or even those of demons are there, they will
be splintered and falling down apiece by the fusillades of my arrows... [3-64-68b, 69a]


"Whether she is abducted, or even if she is killed, oh, Soumitri, if the gods are
not going to give back my Seetha I will now jeopardise these worlds with my arrows... [3-64-69b,
70a]


"If my ladylove is not returned indeed in a fine fettle as she was before my running
after Golden Deer, I will be annihilating the triad of world in its entirety, together with its
mobile and sessile beings, and I will be sweltering the entire universe with my arrows as long as I
am not going to get a glimpse of her." Thus Rama gave a vent to his feelings. [3-64-70b, 71a]


Rama on saying thus with his eyes reddening in fury, his lappet-fold of lips jerking
spasmodically, he girded up his jute-cloths and deerskin and twined up the mass of his matted-hair.
[3-64-72]


When the disposition of that venturesome and infuriated Rama has become in that way
holocaustic, it is like that of Rudra, the All-Inflamer god, when He became like this in earlier
times, intending to inflame the Triple-Cities. [3-64-73]


On saying so that illustrious Rama, the delighter of world, grabbed his bow from
Lakshmana and gripped it tightly, unholstered a deadly and dazzling arrow from his quiver which is
like a poisonous serpent, and readying it on the bowstring of his bow, that Rama, the vanquisher of
enemies fastnesses, who looked like the Ear-End-Fire, spoke this sentence. [3-64-74, 75]


"As to how all the created beings cannot counteract the ageing, dying, fate and the
Time at anytime, likewise I too am non-countervailed, when I am coalesced with fury, no doubt about
it..." [3-64-76]


"If that princess of Mithila, who has suavely and toothy smiles and who causes
irreproachability to my character if only I can have a glimpse of her, is not returned to me in
fine fettle as she was when she was with me, then I will countermove whole of this universe
together with its gods, immortals, humans, florae and faunas, mountains and waters... and
whatnot... [3-64-77]
