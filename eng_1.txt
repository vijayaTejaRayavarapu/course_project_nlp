To him, to such an effectual and virtuously great-souled King Dasharatha, a dynasty-enriching son is
not begotten though his heart is burning to beget children. [1-8-1]

To that anguished great-soul, a thought occurred this way, "To beget sons, why should not I perform
Horse ritual...[and thus appease the gods in order to beget worthy sons..."] [1-8-2]

That intellectual and a conscientious king having resolved with all of his sagacious ministers that such
a Vedic ritual is performable, then addressed best ne among ministers, namely Sumantra, "fetch all my teachers and
clerics, quickly.." [1-8-3,4]

Then Sumantra gone quickly, for he in quickness is a dauntless one, and fetched all of the clerics like
Suyajna, Vaama Deva, Jaabala, Kashyapa, and even Sage Vashishta, and also those other eminent Brahman that are Vedic
scholars. [1-8-5,6]

Then on adoring them virtuous King Dasharatha spoke this impressible sentence that included
justification and meaning. [1-8-7]

"My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... for that reason, I wish perform Aswamedha,
Vedic Horse Ritual... this is my thinking... [1-8-8]

"Therefore, I contemplate to perform that ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and as a rite-oriented
one as well... let this contemplation of mine be well thought of... and as to how my desire to beget sons will be
fulfilled... [1-8-9]

Then the Brahman scholars along with Sage Vashishta and all other important personalities in their turn
have blessed and honoured him, saying that "splendid is this idea..." thus, for that which is voiced by the king.
[1-8-10]

All of them becoming happy have also said to King Dasharatha, "let the paraphernalia be provided, and
your ritual-horse be released... [1-8-11]

"Oh, king, by all means you will beget sons as you desired, since you, to whom an upright thinking has
suggested itself... let the ritual ground be arranged on the northern banks of River Sarayu..." So said the scholars.
[1-8-12, 13a]

" Then King Dasharatha is gladdened on hearing the sayings of those Brahmans. And with happiness
lurching on his eyes the king spoke to the ministers, "As advised by my Vedic teachers let the paraphernalia be
procured... [1-8-13b, 14]

"On the northern banks of River Sarayu the ritual ground be arranged... and the Ritual-Horse be released
monitored by capable warriors, along with the religious teachers..." So said the king. [1-8-15]

"Let peace invocations be prevailing and prospering, as ordained in the scriptures and tradition...if it
is possible for the correct performance to obtain results of this ritual, and if it is possible to conduct this ritual
without any difficult faults during its performance, then all the kings on earth would have performed it... [1-8-16]

"Scholarly Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults alone in the course of this ritual... should the
procedure of this ritual be depraved of its set rules, the performer gets ruined... [1-8-17]

"Therefore, you all shall see as to how this ritual of mine be conducted and concluded procedurally, and
all of you are evidently experts in conducting such rituals... isn't it! [1-8-18]

On listening the words of the king all the ministers adored and assured him saying, 'It will be
conducted faultlessly as has been conducted earlier...' [1-8-19]

On hearing those words of that best king, and what that is spoken earlier, then the virtue knowing
Brahman scholars hailing that best king took leave of him and went away as they have come. [1-8-20]

Then on sending off those Brahman scholars, the king spoke this way to the ministers... "As advised by
the Vedic scholars this ritual shall be conducted, procedurally..." [1-8-21]

Tha tigerly-king and highly intellectual Dasharatha, on saying thus to his ministers who are still in
his audience, sent away those ministers also, and he entered his palace. [1-8-22]

And on approaching his wives, that best king's heartily dear ones, he said to them, " I am performing a
Vedic ritual for the reason of begetting sons, and you all shall enter a vow..." [1-8-23]

On hearing those words of the king, the lustrous countenances of the queens have become more gleaming,
like the blooming lotuses after the clearance of dew-fall. [1-8-24]

On hearing the worthy words of that sage with inestimable power, then the tigerly man Rama 
replied him with estimable words. [1-25-1]

"It is said that yaksha's strength is trivial, and this is an yakshii, more so a female, how 
then this yakshii frail by her femineity can exert the strength of a thousand elephants? [1-25-2]

On hearing the sentence of Raghava with illimitable dynamism, Vishvamitra said this sentence 
to the enemy subduer Rama along with Lakshmana, cheering them up with his pleasant words, 
"Listen by which a female became outstanding by her strength... she assumes strength by the 
bestowal of a boon. [1-25-3, 4]

"Once there was a formidable yaksha named Suketu, but he was childless, and he who had devout 
conduct performed a great ascesis. [1-25-5]

"Gladdening at his ascesis, Rama, then the Forefather Brahma gave him a gemlike daughter who 
is renowned by the name of Tataka. [1-25-6]

"Forefather Brahma also gave the strength of a thousand elephants to her, but he that highly 
remarkable Brahma did not give a son to that yaksha, anticipating male to be more hazardous. 
[1-25-7]

"When that bright girl is growing up into a youthful beauty her father Suketu gave her to 
Jambha's son Sunda as wife. [1-25-8]

"Then after sometime that yakshii Tataka delivered an indomitable son named Mareecha, who 
by curse became a demon. [1-25-9]

"But when Sunda is eliminated by sage Agastya's curse, she that Tataka wished to retaliate 
that eminent sage along with her son Mareecha. [1-25-10]

"With desperation brewing in her she roaringly rushed towards the sage as though to eat him 
away, and on seeing her rushing along with her son Mareecha towards him, the godly saint Agastya 
firstly cursed Mareecha saying, 'you will attain demon-hood.' [1-25-11, 12a]

"Highly infuriated sage Agastya even cursed Tataka saying, 'forthwith divested of this form 
of a beautiful female, oh, great yakshii, you shall become a man eater with your form distorted, 
face contorted, and shape monstrous.' [1-25-12b, 13]

"Frenzied by the curse and convulsed in fury she that Tataka is thus vandalising this auspicious 
province, in which sage Agastya once sauntered. [1-25-14]

"She that highly atrocious one is with horrific behaviour and malefic valour, hence you shall 
eliminate this yakshii for the welfare of Brahmans and cows. [1-25-15]

"Excepting you there is none to eliminate her who is indomitably sheathed in a curse, oh, 
Raghu's legatee, and none in the three worlds can possibly brave her. [1-25-16]

"Compassion regarding the elimination of a female is ungermane, oh, best one among men, since 
a prince has to effectuate it intending the welfare of four categories of society. [1-25-17]

"For the reason of protecting people, a protector always has to execute such deed, either 
it is ruthless or humane, sinful or vilifying. [1-25-18]

"To the nominee who bears the burden of kingdom this is the age-old duty, and hence oh, Rama, 
the legatee of Kakutstha, eliminate this infamy, as goodness is inevident in her, isn't it. 
[1-25-19]

"Oh, Rama, the protector of people, we have heard that Indra once eliminated Manthara, the 
daughter of Virochana, when she wished to annihilate earth, haven't we. [1-25-20]

"And Rama, once Vishnu wiped out even the wife of sage Bhrigu and sage Shukracarya's mother 
when she wished the world to become one without a governing factor, namely Indra. [1-25-21]

"Oh, prince, these great souls and many other celebrated personalities have eliminated females 
who deported themselves with unrighteousness, and hence, oh, Rama, the protector of people, 
by my decree you leave off compassion and eliminate her." Thus said sage Vishvamitra to Rama 
regarding Tataka's elimination. [1-25-22]

Sumantra, the charioteer and one of the misters of King Dasharatha, having heard all about 
the king's desire to perform a Vedic ritual, said this in confidence to king, "oh, king, I 
will tell an early legend, an early legendary narration that I listened... [1-9-1]

"Oh, king, I have earlier heard of this present advice given to you by Vedic scholars, as 
godly Sage Sanatkumara has once narrated an account about the arrival of your sons in the 
presence of other sages, and sage Sanat Kumara said... [1-9-2, 3a]

"He said that "Sage Kashyapa has a son known as Vibhaandaka, and his son will be the renowned 
Sage Rishyasringa, and that Sage Rishyasringa will grow up in forests, and will always be 
dwelling in forest... [1-9-3b, 4]



"Not knowing others, that Brahman the best, namely Rishyasringa, will always be abiding his 
father and he will follow celibacy of two kinds Brahmanical vows namely
<font color="#B3003A">vratitva</font> , <font color="#B3003A">praajaapatya</font> ...

Not knowing others that Brahman the best, will always be abiding his father, lest his renowned 
celibacy always praised by the Brahmans, will be hindered. [1-9-5]

"In the world he becomes famous for his celibacy, oh king, and he will always be praised by 
Brahmans, and thus time will pass on with that kind of his conduct. [1-9-6]

Sage Rishyasringa looses no time with his servitor-ship to the Sacrificial Fire and also to 
his celebrated father, and during this period alone there will be a famed and very strong 
king Romapaada, a valiant in Anga country... [1-9-7, 8a]

"But by a violation of righteousness of that king there will be a shocking and devastating 
famine in that country...[1-9-8b, 9a]

"While the famine is besetting that king Roamapada will be afflicted with grim, and on summoning 
Brahmans and learned scholars he will address them... [1-9-9b. 10a]

"All of you are well versed in rituals and knowers of the world history... order me how to 
how the purification from sin will be... [1-9-10b, 11a]

"Thus said by king those scholarly Brahmans and Vedic scholars will say to the king, 'oh, 
king, son of Sage Vibhaandaka, namely Rishyasringa, is to be fetched by all methods... [1-9-11b, 
12]

"Oh! King, having brought Sage Rishyasringa and honouring him well with good care, procedurally 
give him your daughter Shanta in marriage to that Vedic Brahman and the son of Sage Vibhaandaka... 
[1-9-13]

"On listening them the king becomes thoughtful about the idea by which it is possible to bring 
that self-controlled sage to his place... [1-9-14]

"Then that intellectual king decides along with ministers, to dispatch clergymen and ministers, 
honouring them well, and then sends them... [1-9-15]

"They on hearing king's words are awestruck and lowering their faces they will say, 'we can 
not go there as we are afraid of sage Vibhandaka, father of Rishyasringa...' [1-9-16]

"After thinking over they will say as a second thought, and having found a solution with a 
plan to bring that sage, 'we will fetch that Brahman and also by that no stigma will occur...' 
[1-9-18]

"Thus by the king of Anga kingdom and by his courtesans the son of sage Rishyasringa will 
be brought and the presiding deity for rains will shower rains, and Shanta will also be given 
in marriage to that sage...' [1-9-18]

"Sage Rishyasringa, son-in-law of Romapaada, King of Anga ad as well as to you, if invited 
to our kingdom he will bless you to beget sons, oh! King... so said Sage Sanatkumaara to other 
sages and all this is retold by me." [Thus the charioteer and the Minister Sumantra completed 
his narration in confidence to King Dasharatha.] [1-9-19]

Then King Dasharatha is delighted and in turn spoke to Sumantra "By what idea Rishyasringa 
is brought to Anga kingdom, that shall be said elaborately..." [1-9-20]

Once upon a time, under which victorious kings, starting from Prajapati-s, this entire earth with all its islands is there, among which kings one 
king named Sagara is there, well-known for his deepening the oceans, 
and whom his sixty thousand sons were fencing in when he is set out for action, in the dynasty 
of such Ikshvaku kings this highly revered and reputed epic Ramayana is originated. 
[1-5-1, 3]

Being such a legend, we two wish to relate this Ramayana entirely and completely from the 
beginning, which is endowed with the values and means of probity, prosperity, and pleasure 
seeking... and this be listened without any caviling. [1-5-4]

A great kingdom named Kosala, a joyous and a vast one well flourishing with monies and cereals, 
is snugly situated on the riverbanks of Sarayu. [1-5-5]

A world-renowned city is there in that kingdom, which is personally built by Manu, the foremost 
ruler of mankind. [1-4-6]

That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s 
breadth wise. [1-5-7]

That city shines forth with well-laid great royal highways that are always wetted with water, 
and with flowers strewn and scattered on them. [1-5-8]

As an improver of great kingdom Dasharatha the king made her as his abode, as Indra made heavens 
as his abode. [1-5-9]

That city is surrounded with gateways and archways; the front yards of buildings are well 
laid; it is lodges all kinds of machinery, weaponry and craftsmen, and king Dasharatha dwells 
in such a city. [1-4-10]

She that prosperous city Ayodhya is muchly crammed with many a eulogist and panegyrist, yet 
she is highly splendorous with many a bastion, flag and hundreds of batteries of canons, and 
Dasharatha dwells therein. [1-5-11]

That city Ayodhya accommodates groups of danseuses and theatrical personnel, and she is surrounded 
everywhere with the gardens and brakes of mango trees, and her wide fort-wall is like her 
cincture ornament. [1-5-12]

That Ayodhya is an impassable one for trespassers, or for others invaders, owing to her impassable 
and profound moats, and she is abounding with horses, camels, likewise with cows and donkeys. 
[1-5-13]

With the throngs of provincial kings who come hither to pay dues pervade that city, and she 
is verily lustrous with residents of various other countries, and with traders, too. In such 
a city Dasharatha dwells. [1-5-14]

Buildings are ornamentally studded with precious gems, and with such multi-storied sky scrappers 
she is adorned, and filled with them she is like Amaravati, the capital of Indra. [1-5-15]

Amazing is Ayodhya for its lay-out is like a game board called <em>aSTapadi</em>, and with 
its flocks of beautiful women moving thereabout, where all kinds of precious gems are heaped 
up, and where its seven storied buildings are picturesque. [1-5-16]

The housing is very dense and there is no place or ground unutilized, and all are constructed 
on well-levelled lands, and rice-grain is plentiful while the drinking water tastes like sugar 
cane juice. [1-5-17]

That city is sounding with the drumbeats of great drums, and with musical rhythm instruments 
like mridanga, cymbals, and with string instruments like Veena etc., and on earth she is uniquely 
the best city. [1-5-18]

Ayodhya is like a hovering space station attained by sages by their ascesis, and its edifices 
are well planned and it is teeming with best people. [1-4-19]

They the skilful archers of that Ayodhya will not kill a lone one with their arrows, one that 
does not have either a predecessor or a successor in his family, a fleeing one, or by listening 
to the sound of the target, as is done in sonic-archery, and their skills, acumen and handiness 
are thus benevolent. [1-5-20]

They kill the fattened and roaring lions, tigers and wild boars with the might of their sharp 
weaponry, or even with the might of their own arms alone. [1-4-21]

With that kind of thousands of archers, and with speediest chariot-warriors she that Ayodhya 
is filled with, and King Dasharatha made his abode in such a city. [1-5-22]

She that Ayodhya is encompassed with Vedic scholars who always worship the ritual fire by 
enkindling the three kinds of ritual-fires continuously, virtuous Brahman scholars in Veda-s 
and their six ancillary subjects, and other great souls that are in similitude with great 
saints, and who are just like sages that are charitable donors, and that abide by the truth.

			On hearing the wavery words of Dasharatha that are full of fond for his son, 
			Vishvamitra wrathfully replied this sentence to the king. [1-21-1]

			"On promising me to fulfil my object in the first instance you wish to repudiate 
			it now, undeserving is this kind of deviation for the kings of Raghava dynasty. 
			[1-21-2]

			"If this is worth while to you, oh, king, I wish to go away as I have come, and 
			you with your feigned promises be nonchalantly happy with your kinsmen." So said 
			Vishvamitra to the king. [1-21-3]

			When that prudent sage Vishvamitra is thus enwrapped in fury, then the whole earth 
			trembled and the gods are scared. [1-21-4]

			On knowing the appalled appearance of the entire world at the fury of Vishvamitra, 
			Vashishta the great sage with high vows and an insightful one too, said these 
			words to the king. [1-21-5]

			"Born in Ikshwaku dynasty you are apparently the other god of ethics on earth, 
			a staunch one with righteous vows and a glorious one too, such as you are, it 
			will be unapt of you to forsake ethics." [1-21-6]

			"In three worlds you are renowned as the right-minded one, oh, Raghava, hence 
			adhere to your own uprightness, and adhering to unrighteousness will be unapt 
			of you. [1-21-7]

			"Promising to effectuate something in any way and not effectuating the given word 
			results in the perdition to the merits of <font color=" #B3003A">iSTaapuurta</font> 
			Vedic rituals, hence oh, Raghava, leave hold of Rama. [1-21-8]

			"Whether Rama is trained in weaponry or not, demons cannot trounce Rama as long 
			as Kushi's son Vishvamitra protects him, like the heavenly firewall that protects 
			divine nectar. [1-21-9]

			"He is an embodiment of virtue, matchless among the venturesome, peerless in intellect 
			among all in the world, and flawless in ascesis. [1-21-10]

			"He is in the know-how of various missiles, and no other person is there in the 
			triad of worlds, inclusive of sessile and mobile worlds, who is knowledgeable 
			about him, or someone who can know him will be there in future, excepting myself. 
			[1-21-11]

			"While Gods cannot know Vishvamitra, can anybody from sages - no; immortals- no; demons 
			- no; the gandharva-s and eminent yaksha-s together with the kinnaraa-s and great 
			reptile beings - no, they cannot know him. [1-21-12]

			"All the missiles known to Vishvamitra are the highly righteous children of Krishaashva 
			Prajapati, where Prajapati-s were the earliest ruler of mankind, and god Shiva 
			gave them to Vishvamitra when was ruling kingdom. [1-21-13]

			"Those missiles are the sons of Daksha Prajaapati's daughters and her husband 
			Krishaasva Prajapati, and they are disparate in their form, intrepid, dazzling, 
			and victory-oriented missiles. [1-21-14]

			"Jaya and Suprabha, the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, endowed with best waists 
			gave birth to a hundred missiles and weaponry whose flare is supreme. [1-21-15]

			"On getting a boon Jaya named wife of Krishaasva Prajapati is benefited with fifty 
			best and formless sons with immeasurable fortitude for the destruction of ungodly 
			beings. [1-21-16]

			"Suprabha, another wife of Krishaasva Prajapati, gave birth to another fifty unassailable, 
			unconquerable and mighty sons named the Eliminators. [1-21-17]

			"And this sage Vishvamitra is in the precise know of the said missiles, and this 
			principled one is also capable of creating hitherto unavailable missiles. [1-21-18]

			"Thereby, oh, Raghava, nothing whatsoever is unknown to this great-souled Vishvamitra, 
			who is a distinguished sage and the knower of virtue, either that has happened 
			or that is happening. [1-21-19]

			"Thus, the highly renowned and great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has this sort 
			of enterprise, oh, king, allowing a doubt enter your mind in Rama's accompanying 
			the sage will be unapt of you. [1-21-20]

			"This son of Kushi, Vishvamitra, can as well control those demons by himself, 
			but intending to accord beneficence to your son he approached you and imploring 
			upon you. [1-21-21]

			Thus the prominent king from Raghu dynasty, namely Dasharatha, became serene-minded 
			by sage Vashishta's words, and he who is supreme among other kings and who has 
			pronounced renown, that Dasharatha then gladly and wholeheartedly consented to 
			the travel of Rama along with the sage Vishvamitra. [1-21-22]

At dawn after that night the great saint Vishvamitra spoke to the legatees of Kakutstha, Rama 
and Lakshmana, those that are sleeping on a grass bed. [1-23-1]

"Fortunate is Kausalya to beget you as her son Rama... get up oh, tigerly-man, eastern aurora 
is emerging, daytime tasks towards gods are to be performed." [1-23-2]

On hearing the benign words of the sage those valorous and best ones among men got up, bathed, 
and on offering water oblation they meditated upon the supreme hymn, namely Gayatri. [1-23-3]

On performing their dawn time duties those two stalwarts, Rama and Lakshmana, enthusiastically 
presented themselves before the ascetically rich sage Vishvamitra for further journey, duly 
venerating him. [1-23-4]

Then on travelling some more distance those two great valiant ones, there they have seen the 
divine river that courses in three ways, namely Ganga, at the auspicious confluence of River 
Sarayu. [1-23-5]

There they have seen the merited hermitage of sages with contemplative souls, and who are 
practising supreme ascesis for many thousand years. [1-23-6]

On seeing that merited hermitage Rama and Lakshmana are highly pleased and said this word 
to that great-soul Sage Vishvamitra. [1-23-7]

"Whose hermitage is this merited one? Indeed who is the celebrity that lives therein? Oh, 
godly sage, we are interested to listen, and we are truly inquisitive about it." Thus they 
asked. [1-23-8]

On hearing their words the eminent sage Viswamitra said smilingly, " whose hermitage is this 
in earlier times that may be listened." Thus Vishvamitra started to narrate. [1-23-9]

"When Love-god was with his body wise men used to call him Kama, the passion. At this place, 
that Love-god with his naughty intent braved god of gods Shiva who had been practising ascesis 
and who concentrated observantly, and who was returning after his marriage along with his 
followers, namely the Wind-gods, and that great soul Shiva disapprovingly roared at Love-god. 
[1-23-10, 11]

"And Rama, the wrathful third-eye of Shiva destroyed the lewd-minded Love-god making all his 
limbs to fall down from his body. [1-23-12]

"There the body of Love-god is evanesced when that great soul Shiva burnt it down, and by 
the anger of that god of gods Shiva, Love-god is rendered as a bodiless entity. [1-23-13]

Then onwards Love-god is renowned as Ananga, as he is without body, and where his body is 
given up that is renowned as Anga province. [1-23-14]

"This merited hermitage thus belongs to Shiva and, oh, brave Rama, these sages abiding in 
virtue are Shiva's disciples at one time, thus sin is unverifiable with them. [1-23-15]

"Let us stay for this night in this hermitage situated in between two meritorious rivers Ganga 
and Sarayu, oh, Rama with auspicious mien, tomorrow we will cross over the River Ganga. [1-23-16]

"Let us all purify ourselves by taking our bath, performing our meditations, offering our 
daily oblations, and then let us enter this meritorious hermitage, thus our stay in here will 
be comforting to us." So said Vishvamitra to Rama and Lakshmana. [1-23-17, 18a]

When they are discussing there the sages of that hermitage are highly gladdened to perceive 
them with their sixth-sense, and on approaching them enchantedly they offered water for hands 
and feet wash and then offered hospitality firstly to Sage Vishvamitra. [1-23-18, 19]

Afterwards those sages of that hermitage have accorded reception to Rama and Lakshmana, and 
applauded by Vishvamitra for their hospitality those sages have entertained Rama and other 
guests with myths and legends. [1-23-20]

Those sages with concentrated minds and according to one's own aptitude have meditated upon 
the deity of sunset when it is sundown, followed by Rama and others. Then led into hermitage 
by those sages who are with pious commitments and who are dwelling there, Rama and others 
have very comfortably stayed in the precincts of Shiva's hermitage. [1-23-21]

Staying very comfortably in the precincts of Kaama hermitage, 
then that virtuous sage Vishvamitra, saint the eminent, delighted the delightful princes with delighting stories.....[1-23-22]

			The misters for the great soul from Ikshvaku kings of Emperor Dasharatha, are 
			epitomised ones of their tactfulness, adroitness and are always obliged to undertake 
			welfare activities of their king and the kingdom. [1-7-1]

			Eight ministers are there for that valiant and glorious King Dasharatha, who are 
			clean at heart and are involved in the works of the king and kingdom at all time. 
			[1-7-2]

			Dhristi, Jayantha, Vijaya, Suraashtra, Raashtravardhana, Akopa, Dharmapaala, are 
			seven, and Sumantra is the eighth one. [1-7-3]

			Two venerable saints of eminence are religious ministers for they are authorities 
			in Vedic rituals, namely Vashishta and Vamadeva, who are the acquiescent with 
			religious matters, and apart from these two some more religious ministers are 
			also there to King Dasharatha. [1-7-4]

			Suyajna, Jabaali, Kaashyapa, Gautama, Maarkandeya, Deerghaayu, and then Kaatyayana 
			are the scholarly Brahmans acting as religious ministers, and along with them 
			there are also Brahma-sages who are always the ancestral ritual scholars for Dasharatha's 
			family. [1-7-5, 6a]

			All the ministers are well versed in scriptures, they shun bad deeds, skilful 
			ones in their duties with their senses regulated. Those great souls are affluent, 
			knowers of all sciences, firmly courageous, and they are distinguished and quiet-souls, 
			and those ministers are true to their word. They are magnificent, patient and 
			famed ones and they smile afore they converse. [1-7-6b, 8a]

			They never speak untruthful words in anger or in greed or for monetary reasons 
			either. There is nothing unknown to them, even a little, in their own country 
			or in the others either, or about everything that is happening or has happened, 
			or that is going to happen, for they know them through agents. [1-7-8b, 9]

			They are efficient in administration and their friendships are well examined by 
			the king, and those ministers impose punishment even on their own sons, if situation 
			demands it. [1-7-10]

			In collections to their treasury and to militarise their armies they are dutiful, 
			even an unfriendly person will not be tortured, if he were not really blameworthy. 
			[1-7-11]

			They are valiant ones with engineered enthusiasm, administrators of political 
			science, clean persons and protectors of subjects of their kingdom at all times. 
			[1-7-12]

			They do not persecute Brahman-s and Kshatriya-s to fill-up the treasury, and high 
			degree punishments will be given on assessing that person's, or the offender's 
			strength and weakness. [1-7-13]

			All of those ministers are clean administrators of kingdom, and are in league 
			with each other, as such there is none anywhere, either in capital or in country, 
			a liar. [1-7-14]

			None with an evil-mind or with an interest in other man's wife is there, and thus 
			on whole in the kingdom and also like that in the capital, there is an undisturbed 
			society. [1-7-15]

			Well-dressed and well-decorated and they the ministers of King Dasharatha, observe 
			decency in the interest of the king and also of the kingdom, with diligence and 
			with a truthful-eye. [1-7-16]

			They acquired good qualities from their mentors and they are renowned by their 
			expertise, and even in foreign countries they are famous for their intellectual 
			determinations in all affairs. [1-7-17]

			Versatile and virtuous are they the ministers and there is none who discarded 
			his virtuosity, and they are the determiners of truce or war, and by their nature 
			they possess opulence. [1-7-18]

			They are capable to keep up the confidentialities of strategies, and also capable 
			to apply their mind even in micro-affairs, and they know moral science comprehensively, 
			and above all, they are gentle articulators. [1-7-19]

			Accompanied with such of those effectual and good-natured ministers the exalted 
			king Dasharatha ruled the earth. [1-7-20]

			He that most generous one among men, Dasharatha, while observing through spies, 
			and to protect people righteously, and to give a good governance to them, he forsook 
			unrighteousness and became a generous king avowed to truthfulness alone, and thus 
			he that Dasharatha ruled the earth, which rulership is renowned in all the three 
			worlds. [1-7-21,22]

			Emperor Dasharatha has not encountered either a superior or an equal in his kingship, 
			and to him there are many friends, subdued are his provincial kings and eliminated 
			is thorniness by his own valour. He thus ruled the world like Indra would in Heaven. 
			[1-7-23]

			In the company of those ministers, who are conducive to the strategies, interested 
			in the king and subjects as well, skilful and efficient ones, he that King Dasharatha 
			obtained brilliance, like the rising Sun along with resplendent sunrays. [1-7-24]

Rejoicing for achieving the result of their journey with Vishvamitra, the brave 
Rama and Lakshmana then resided in that hermitage for that night, gladdening in 
their heart of hearts. [1-31-1]

When that night turned into a new day, performing their morning chores both of the 
brother jointly approached Sage Vishvamitra, who is along with other sages by then. 
[1-31-2]

And those gentle-speakers on reverencing that eminent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance 
is akin to the ritual-fire, they two spoke this highly courteous sentence to him. 
[1-31-3]

"Oh, tigerly-sage, here are your attendants sir, available in your attendance, what 
order is to be carried out further, oh, eminent saint, that you may order us. [1-31-4]

When they have said that way all those great sages spoke to Rama, keeping Vishvamitra 
at the helm of affairs. [1-31-5]

"Oh, best one among men, a highly righteous Vedic ritual belonging to King Janaka 
of Mithila is going to take place, and we the sages are going over there. [1-31-6]

"Oh, tigerly-man Rama, if you can come along with us, it will be expedient for you 
to see a monumental gem of bow there. [1-31-7]

"Oh, best one among men, in early times indeed gods gave that awesome bow which 
has an unimaginable power and which is superbly incandescent in wars to an erstwhile 
king of Mithila in a congregation of a Vedic-ritual. [1-31-8]

"Gods cannot capably lift it to string; gandharva-s, no; asura-s, no; demons, no; 
and for human beings, not in any way. [1-31-9]

"Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great 
mighty princes are rendered incapable to string its bowstring. [1-31-10]

"Oh, tigerly-man Rama, there in Mithila you can see that particular bow of the great-souled 
king of Mithila and his highly admirable Vedic ritual too, if you come with us. 
[1-31-11]

"Once Devaraata, the grandparent of the present king Janaka of Mithila, conducted 
a Vedic-ritual and he indeed prayed only for this supreme bow with a best grip-handle 
as the fruit of that ritual from all of the gods and oh, tigerly man Rama, he got 
the same from them. [1-31-12]

"That bow has got a regular worship and especially during the periods of
<font color="#B3003A">dhanur utsava</font>-s, festivals of bows-and- arrows. Hence 
it is kept in the palace of King of Mithila, and oh, Raghava it is worshipped with 
a variety of sandalwood pastes, scents of aloe substance, and with incenses." [1-31-13]

Saying so that best saint Vishvamitra started to travel on along with the assemblages 
of sages, and even along with Rama and Lakshmana, whose tacit consent to follow 
the sage is obtained by now, and on bidding farewell to the deities of woodlands 
of that Accomplished Hermitage, where his ritual is accomplished with the help of 
Rama and Lakshmana. [1-31-14]

"Adieu, georgic deities, everything bodes well to you all, on accomplishment of 
the ritual I have undertaken here, I wish to go from this Accomplished Hermitage 
towards the ranges of Himalayan Mountains that are on the northern bank of River 
Ganga." [1-31-15]

Thus saying farewell to woodland-deities that descendent of Kaushika, namely Vishvamitra, 
the saint whose wealth is his ascesis started to journey on aiming to reach the 
northern side of River Ganga. [1-31-16]

While that best saint set forth, the team of his close followers who are the advocators 
of Vedic canons have moved behind him, approximately with a hundred carts loaded 
with their ritual paraphernalia. [1-31-17]

Even the residents of that Hermitage of Accomplishment, namely animals and birds, 
closely followed that great-souled Vishvamitra, whose wealth is his ascesis, in 
herds and flocks. But that sage Vishvamitra made those flocks of birds and the herds 
of animals to return to their places, as they have shown enough courtesy. [1-31-18, 
19a]

Those assemblages of sages on going far on their path made a camp on the bank of 
River Sona when the sun is dangling towards west. [1-31-19b, 20a]

When the sun went into dusk those sages with illimitable resplendence took their 
bath and on kindling the consumer of kindled oblations they completed their evening 
fire ritual, and then squatted before sage Vishvamitra. [1-31-20b, 21a]

And even Rama along with Lakshmana on worshipping those sages squatted before that 
intellectual Vishvamitra. [1-31-21b, 22a]

With growing inquisitiveness that resplendent Rama has asked the tigerly sage Vishvamitra 
whose wealth is his ascesis. [1-31-22b, 23a]

"Oh, godly sage, this place is glistening with well-developed woodlands, really 
what is this place? You be blest! It will be apt of you tell about it, in essence." 
Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra.[1-31-23b, 24a]

Sage Vishvamitra whose vows are unselfish and whose ascesis is exalted is motivated 
with the words of Rama and staying amidst the sages he started to tell all about 
that place. [1-31-24b, c]

			When Vishnu attained the sonship of the great-souled king Dasharatha, then Brahma 
			the self-created addressed all of the gods this way. [1-17-1]

			"Let mighty and guise changing helpmates be procreated to that truth abiding and 
			valorous Vishnu who is the well-wisher of all of us. [1-17-2]

			"Let monkey-shaped progeny equalling Vishnu's valour be procreated from the physiques 
			of prominent apsara-s and gandharva-s, from the girls of yaksha-s and pannaga-s, 
			and also thus from the bodies of kinnaraa-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, she-riksha-s 
			and she-monkeys, and they shall be wizards of miracles and audacious ones, in 
			travel they shall have air's speed, bestowed with intellect they shall be the 
			knowers of ideation, and with their divine physique they shall be ineliminable, 
			they shall be endowed with all the assaultive aspects of all missiles, and they 
			shall be untiring in their efforts, like you who thrive on amrita, the ambrosia, 
			unmindful of thirst and hunger. [1-17-3, 4, 5, 6]

			"I have already created the eminent bear Jambavanta in earlier times, as he suddenly 
			came forth from my yawning face. [1-17-7]

			When Brahma addressed them thus, those gods have agreed to his order and accordingly 
			started to parent sons in the resemblance of monkeys. [1-17-8]

			The great-souled celestial groups, namely the sages, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, 
			caarana-s have created valiant sons that are forest rangers. [1-17-9]

			Indra procreated the lord of vanara-s, namely Vali, who by his physique is like 
			Mt. Mahendra, and the highest humidifier among all the humidifiers, namely the 
			Sun, procreated Sugreeva. [1-17-10]

			Brihaspati, the Jupiter, gave rise to a great monkey named Tara, who is the most 
			important one among all vanara-s, and who excels all by his intelligence. [1-17-11]

			The brilliant Gandhamaadana is the son of Kubera, while the divine architect Vishvakarma 
			procreated the great monkey called Nala. [1-17-12]

			The bright son of Fire is Neela whose blaze is like that of fire and who excels 
			other monkeys by his resplendence, renown and courage. [1-17-13]

			The Ashwin twin gods whose wealth is their beautiful appearance have personally 
			procreated two vanara-s namely Mainda and Dvivida, blessing them with beautiful 
			appearance.[1-17-14]

			The Rain-god procreated the vanara named Sushena, and Thunder-god gave rise 
			to the great mighty Sharabha. [1-17-15]

			The direct son of Air-god is the marvellous and adventurous Hanuma with an indestructible 
			body, and one identical in the speed of lady Vinata's son, namely Garuda, the 
			divine eagle vehicle of Vishnu, and among all monkey chiefs he is the intelligent 
			and the indefatigable one too. [1-17-16, 17a]

			Thus the gods have procreated many thousands of such valorous and guise changing 
			monkeys who with their immeasurable strength and bravery are manifest for the 
			elimination of the decahedral demon Ravana. [1-17-17b, 18a]

			And they with their elephantine, mountainous and prodigious bodies quickly took 
			birth in bears, monkeys, sacred langoors. [1-17-18b, 19a]

			Those that are procreated have attained the shape, getup and valour of the god 
			that has fathered them, and thus the monkey race is procreated separately and 
			individually. [1-17-19b, 20a]

			Some of the vanara-s endowed with superior valour are born to female langoors, 
			and like that some more to female bears and kinnaraa-s. [1-17-20b, 21a]

			Several of the gods, great-sages, gandharva-s, eagles, yaksha-s, and the celebrated 
			reptiles, kimpurusha-s, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, uraga-s and caarana-s and even 
			the prominent maidens of apsara-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, naaga, gandharva-s then 
			gladly procreated all of the thousands of forest-ranging and valiant vanara sons 
			from their bodies that are forest rangers. [21b, 22, 23, 24a, b]

			They are endowed with guise changing faculties, with bodily might and by their 
			pride and might are identical to lions and tigers, and they are born-free in their 
			movement in forests. [1-17-24c, 25a]

			All of them are the assaulters with stones, and all are the attackers with trees, 
			and all have their nails and claws as their weapons, yet all are experts in missiles. 
			[1-17-25b, 26a]

			They can rock greatest mountains, rip firm rooted trees, and with their speed 
			they can agitate the of lord of rivers, namely the ocean. [1-17-26b, 27a]

			They can shatter the ground with their two feet, leap and cross over great oceans, 
			and they can seize the clouds entering arch of heaven. [1-17-27b, 28a]

			They can catch ruttish elephants that tumultuously move in forests, and just with 
			the sound of their blare they make sky flying birds to fall. [1-17-28b, 29a]

			Thus the gods and others have procreated millions of such noble souled Vaanaras 
			as the chiefs of warriors who can change their guise at their wish. [1-17-29b, 
			30a]

			Those vanara generals who took birth thus became the prominent generals among 
			the principle battalions of monkeys, and they have also procreated brave monkeys 
			on their own. [1-17-30a, 31b]

			Some thousands of them stayed on the ridges of Mt. Rikshavat while others reached 
			many kinds of other mountains and forests. [1-17-31b, 32a]

			All of the monkeys stood by the brothers, namely the son of Indra Vali, and the 
			son of sun Sugreeva, and even with the monkey generals like Nala, Neela and Hanuma 
			et al. [1-17-32b, 33]

			All of those who are well-versed in warfare and endowed with the might of divine 
			eagle Garuda, used to thwart the pride of lions, tigers and great snakes just 
			by their own prideful subjugation while they move about the forests. [1-17-34]

			He who is adroit, extremely mighty, and highly indomitable, that Vali protected 
			bears, langoors, and monkeys just by the strength of his arms. [1-17-35]

			The earth with its mountains, forests and oceanward places is overspread with 
			those brave ones that possess diverse physiques and peculiar indication marks 
			of their stock. [1-17-36]

			The earth is thus suffused with those mighty army generals of Vanara race whose 
			physiques resembled the clusters of clouds and peaks of mountains, and who have 
			emerged for the reason of helping Rama. [1-17-37]

Minister Sumantra continued, "oh, the great king, I will further narrate all that has been 
said by Sanat Kumara, the best one among all deities, kindly listen to these favourable words." 
[1-11-1.]

"A king named Dasharatha will be born into Ikshwaku dynasty who will be very virtuous, 
resplendent and truthful one to his vow." [Said Sanat Kumara, the Sage.] [1-11-2]

"King Dasharatha will befriend the king of Anga and the king of Anga will beget a fortunate 
girl named Shanta. [1-11-3]

The son of the king of Anga, the earlier king of Anga kingdom, will be known as Romapada, 
or also know as Chitraratha, and the highly renowned king Dasharatha approaches Romapada. 
[1-11-4]

Then king Dasharatha says to king of Anga "oh, righteous one, I am childless and hence I intend 
to perform a Vedic ritual. Let the husband of your daughter Shanta, Sage Rishyasringa, preside 
over that Vedic ritual at you behest, for the sake of progeny in my dynasty. [1-11-5]

"On hearing those words of king Dasharatha that benevolent soul Romapada, the king of Anga, 
considers heartily and agrees to send the one who endows progeny by rituals, namely Sage Rishyasringa 
his son-in-law. [1-11-6]

"On receiving that Brahman, Sage Rishyasringa, at the behest of his father-in-law, that king 
Dasharatha gets rid of his febrile condition and will accomplish that Vedic ritual, feeling 
very felicitous in the depths of his heart. [1-11-7]

"That king, the desirer of performing vedic ritual, the knower of virtue and the lord of people, namely Dasharatha 
will be requesting that best Brahman Rishyasringa with his palms adjoined in supplication 
for the conduct of ritual, for progeny and even for his heavenly abodes, and that king of 
all the quarters of earth will accomplish those desires from that eminent Brahman Rishyasringa. 
[1-11-8,9]

"There will be four sons to king Dasharatha that abound with valour, enrich dynasty's reputation 
and they will be renowned among all beings." Thus said Sage Sanat Kumara to other sages. [1-11-10]

"This way he that ancient and godly Sage Sanatkumaara, who is also Brahma's brain-child like 
Narada, said this legend in earlier Divine Era, called krita yuga..." thus Sumantra continued 
his narration to Dasharatha. [1-11-11]

" Oh, great king the tigerly-man, he that Sage Rishyasringa be led here on your proceeding 
in person with staff and transport and on adoring him well personally." Thus Sumantra concluded 
his narration. [1-11-12]

On hearing the word of advise from charioteer, Dasharatha became gladsome and made Sumantra 
to reiterate to that sage also, for his approval, then Dasharatha travelled to the place where 
that Brahman Rishyasringa is, along with the inmates of palace-chambers and ministers too. 
[1-11-13, 14a]

On crossing over the rivers and forests slowly and steadily Dasharatha entered that kingdom 
where that eminent Brahman is there. [1-11-14b, 15a]

Then Dasharatha saw that best Brahman who he is nearby king Romapada, and who is resplendent 
like ritual fire. [1-11-15b, 16a]

Then king Romapada gladdened at heart of hearts paid excellent respects to king Dasharatha 
procedurally and in view of their friendship.[1-11-16b, 17a]

Then Romapada informed the wise sage Rishyasringa about the friendship and relation with Dasharatha, 
and then that sage worshipped king Dasharatha in his return. [1-11-17b, 18a]

Thus well received by king Romapada, king Dasharatha spent seven to eight days with him, and 
then spoke this to king Romapada. [1-11-18b, 19a]

"Oh, lord of subjects, your daughter Princess Shanta may go over my city Ayodhya along with 
her husband Rishyasringa, as oh, king, I am contemplating to perform a great Vedic ritual, 
indeed." So said Dasharatha to Romapada. [1-11-19b, 20a]

"So it shall be" said king Romapada agreeing to their travel with king Dasharatha, and addressed 
these words to that Brahman sage and his son-in-law, Sage Rishyasringa "You may proceed along 
with your wife." [1-11-20b, 21a]

Then Rishyasringa agreed and replied to the king Romapada "So it will be done" and then having 
been permitted by the king he set forth along with his wife. [1-11-21b, 22a]

Those valiant kings greeted each other with thanksgiving palm-fold, and in friendship they 
embraced each other and gladdened. [1-11-22b, 23a]

Then king Dasharatha who set forth to Ayodhya bade farewell to his friend king Romapada, and 
he firstly sent quick-footed messengers to Ayodhya to inform his citizens about his arrival 
along with Sage Rishyasringa. [1-11-23b, 24a]

"Let the entire city of Ayodhya be well decorated very quickly, let her streets be sprinkled 
with water and then swept, let the flags of welcome be hoisted.." Thus, king Dasharatha ordered 
messengers that are sent beforehand. [1-11-24b, 25a]

Then on hearing the arrival of their king all the citizens felt very happy and readily performed 
all those works exactly as ordered by their king. [1-11-25b, 26a]

Then king Dasharatha keeping Rishyasringa before him entered the well-decorated city Ayodhya 
amidst the full sounding of conch shells and drumbeats. [1-11-26b, 27a]

Then all the citizens are very happy on seeing that Brahman, Sage Rishyasringa, who is well 
honoured and being entered into the city by their king Dasharatha, as has been done once by 
Indra when he entered sage Kashyapa's son Vamana, the dwarfish boy and the incarnation of 
Vishnu, into heavens, and thus those citizens felt that their human lord Dasharatha vies with 
divine lord Indra. [1-11-27b, 28]

Dasharatha entered the sage into the palace chambers and worshipped him there as ordained 
in the scriptures, and in bringing the Sage here into his country, king Dasharatha believed 
that his desired is fulfilled. [1-11-28]

On seeing her, the broad-eyed Shanta, who came there along with her husband all the ladies 
of palace derived happiness for the homecoming of their own daughter, as it were. [1-11-29]

Shanta thus being admired by all of them, and in an exceptional manner by Dasharatha, comfortably 
resided there along with her husband, the Vedic scholar Rishyasringa. [1-11-31]

King Dasharatha requests Sage Vashishta, the Royal Priest to commence works for the Vedic 
ritual. Sage Vashishta instructs all the concerned about the discipline to be observed in 
executing the works. Sage Vashishta also instructs the minister Sumantra to invite various 
kings of other countries, and those kings will be received with great hospitality. King Dasharatha 
along with his wives takes ritual vow and enters ritual hall.

On completion of one full year another springtime arrived, and then Dasharatha a determined 
one to beget progeny by performing Horse Ritual entered the ritual hall. [1-13-1]

Greeting and even adoring the Sage Vashishta customarily Dasharatha said these very humble 
words to him. [1-13-2]

"Let my ritual be performed scripturally, oh eminent Brahman, let it be conducted in such 
a way that no obstacle occurs even in its ancillary functions. [1-13-3]

"You being my very reverent royal priest are friendly and kind-hearted to me, and you alone 
shall shoulder the burden of the commenced ritual in all good faith and credence. [1-13-4]

Then that reverent Brahman Vashishta said to king, "Whatever that is requested or decided 
by you, I will see that all of them are materialised accordingly. [1-13-5]

Then Sage Vashishta then summoned and spoke to elderly Brahman scholars, and elderly architects 
who are all proficient and elderly experts in conducting the construction of the ritual hall 
etc. Then summoned are the construction supervisors, brick-makers, carpenters, earth-diggers, 
accountants, and sculptors. So also the actors and dancers are summoned. Thus flawless scholars 
in scriptures and those men who are well read in Veda-s, are called and he addressed them 
saying, "Performance of the ritual be organised by the order of the king. Bricks in many thousands 
be brought quickly and royal palaces as temporary guesthouses be built for the kingly guests, 
with very many facilities included in them. [1-13-6,7,8,9]

"Like that, for accommodating Brahmans hundreds of sanctified houses be built, well endowed 
and well established with very many eatables, foods, and potables. [1-13-10]

"So also, accommodation is to be given for city dwellers too, in very spacious housing, and 
severally for the kings arriving from distant places.[1-13-11]

"For horses stables, reposing stalls for elephants, like that great billets for soldiers may 
be built for those foreign-country dwellers arriving in here on their horses and elephants 
along with their soldiers. [1-13-12]

"These lodgings are to be arranged with many foods and utilities for the people of this city 
and for others coming from distant countries, and a very grand food be given in all of them. 
[1-13-13]

"Food is to be given dutifully treating all of them well but not just illusively, and the 
people of all the castes shall be well honoured as they would get their due respect, and no 
disrespect be shown, even when overcome by passion or anger at anyone. [1-13-14, 15a]

"Exceptionally respectable are those men and architects that are preoccupied in the works 
of the ritual as they deserve, and those men involved in these works shall be well-treated 
with funds and food. [1-13-15b, 16]

"Thus, as to how all this be well organised without least negligence, thus you all shall administer 
in all your cooperation and good spirit." Thus Sage Vashishta spoke to the organisers. [1-13-17]

Then all of them collectively replied to Sage Vashishta "As desired, all the well ordered 
works will not be neglected in the least, and they will be done as ordered, and not the least 
of them will be slighted." So said the artisans to Sage Vashishta. [1-13-18, 19a]

"Then on calling for Sumantra, Sage Vashishta said these words to him, "Let all those kings 
of the earth that are righteous be invited, and let all the people from all the kingdoms, 
say Brahmans, Kshatriya-s, Vaisya-s, Shudra-s be invited in scores duly honouring them." So 
said Vashishta to Sumantra. [1-13-19b, 20, 21a]

"You personally invite Janaka the king of Mithila, a valiant one and an advocate of truth, 
honouring his well and duly bearing in mind that he is a long-time associate of our King Dasharatha, 
hence I am telling you in the first instance. [1-13-21b,22]

"Thus that King of Kaashi who is always a friendly, affectionate and a cordial one, indeed 
he shall be invited by you personally. [1-13-23]

"Likewise, King of Kekaya, an elderly, very virtuous, and also the father-in-law of our Lion-King 
Dasharatha, you personally invite him along with his sons. [1-13-24]

"Romapada, the lord of Anga kingdom and the user of great bow, let that illustrious one be 
invited well honoured, for he is the friend of our lion-king Dasharatha. [1-13-25]

"Like that King of Kosala namely Bhanumanta, and the King of Magadha, a brave one and a profound 
one in all scriptural knowledge, let them be honoured well and be invited. [1-13-26]

"And Praaptijna, the king of Magadha, the kind-hearted and best one among kings, be well honoured 
and invited. Further, taking the orders of King Dasharatha and motivated by those orders, 
the kings of Sindhu, Sauviira and Sauraastra kingdoms may also be invited. [1-13-27]

"All of the kings of southern kingdoms be invited, and should there be any other friends and 
other friendly kings on the surface of the earth, they too shall be invited as early as possible 
with all their followers, relatives through highly illustrious envoys, of course with the 
orders of our king." Thus Sage Vashishta said to minister Sumantra. [1-13-28, 29]

On hearing that word of Vashishta, Sumantra expeditiously ordered devout envoys to invite 
all those kings to their kingdom. [1-13-30]

That virtuous Sumantra became brisk upon sage's words and personally journeyed to fetch all 
the rulers on the earth. [1-13-31]

All those artisans engaged in ritual works have reported Vashishta, the details of all those 
ritual works that are accomplished. [1-13-32]

Then, that satisfied saint and eminent Brahman Vashishta, spoke this way to all of them, "nothing 
is to be endowed to anyone either with disrespect or deceptively, the deeds done with disrespect 
will kill the donor and there is no doubt about it." [1-13-33, 34a]

Then in some days and nights many kings have arrived taking precious gems with them as gifts 
for Dasharatha. [1-13-34b, 35a]

Then the well pleased Sage Vashishta said this to King Dasharatha "the kings from distant 
kingdoms have arrived at your behest, oh, tigerly-man, and these best kings are well honoured 
by me also as per their status. [1-13-35b, 36]

"All the ritual works are also completed by the well coalescent men, thus you may start towards 
the ritual place that is nearby, to perform your ritual." Said Sage Vashishta to King Dasharatha. 
[1-13-37]

"All the desirable paraphernalia is arranged and made available everywhere, and it is apt 
of you see ritual hall that is as though built by your mere wish. [1-13-38]

Thus, on a good day while the ruling star of the day is favourable, King Dasharatha came forth 
towards the ritual hall according to the advice of both the sages Vashishta and Rishyasringa. 
[1-13-39]

Then Sage Vashishta and other eminent Brahmans keeping the Sage Rishyasringa ahead of them 
entered the ritual hall, to commence the ritual works thus. [1-13-40]

When all have entered the ritual hall as per canons and custom, that glorious king Dasharatha 
along with his wives undertook vow of ritual. [1-13-41]

On hearing what is spoken by Vishvamitra the tigerly-king Dasharatha became insensate for 
a time, and on redeeming senses he said this. [1-20-1]

""Less than sixteen years of age is my lotus-eyed Rama, and I see no warring aptitude to him 
with the demons. [1-20-2]

"Here is the full-fledged battalion, called <font color="#B3003A">akShouhiNii senaa</font> , 
for which I am the leader and controller, and fortified by this army I will go there to encounter 
those demons. [1-20-3]

"Brave and daring are these soldiers of mine, and as experts in weaponry they are the appropriate 
ones to combat the hordes of demons, but, it will be ungentle of you to take Rama with you. 
[1-20-4]

"I alone with bow in my hand can protect your ritual, and as long as I bear my lives so long 
I war with those nightwalkers staying in the van of war. [1-20-5]

" I myself wish to come over there thereby the works of ritual will be well-guarded and unimpeded, 
but, taking Rama with you will be ungracious of you. [1-20-6]

"Why because, Rama is boy! And he is unschooled in his princely education; does he know the 
strengths and weaknesses of opponents - no; has he got the equipage of arsenal - no; has he 
any expertise in warfare - no; is he an equal to the demons - no; be that as it may, those 
demons definitely conduct a deceitful warfare, isn't it. [1-19-7, 8a]

"Alienated from Rama I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, tigerly sage, hence taking 
Rama with you will be unjust. [1-20-8b, 9a]

"Otherwise, oh, Brahman with best vows, if you so wish to take Rama along with you, you lead 
him off along with me, and along with my four kinds of troops. [1-20-9b, 10a]

"Sixty thousand years have passed from my birth, oh! Vishvamitra, and this Rama is engendered 
at this age, that too with tribulations, hence taking Rama with you will be inappropriate 
of you. [1-20-10b, 11a]

"I will have exceptional affection for all of my four sons, isn't it, and among them Rama 
has a significance in the matter of his descent as an eldest son, hence taking Rama with you 
will be unjust of you. [1-20-11b, 12a]

"Oh, eminent sage, of what fortitude are those demons? Whose sons are they? Who are they? 
How is their size and shape? Also who protects all of them? [1-20-12b, 13a]

"Oh, Brahman, how Rama, or my forces, or I myself have to retaliate those demons that are 
deceitful militants. [1-20-13b, 14a]

"Tell me all that, oh, god, how I have to carry on when warring with those evil minded demons, 
for the demons will be delirious by their audacity, isn't it..." Thus Dasharatha asked Vishvamitra 
insistently. On hearing those words Sage Vishvamitra replied this way. [1-20-14b, 15]

"One born in Paulastya dynasty, an extremely mighty and exceedingly brave demon named Ravana 
is there, and he with the boon given by Brahma, and accompanied with many other demons is 
torturing the triad of worlds, contemptuously. [1-20-16, 17a]

"Unequivocally that chief of demons is the brother of Kubera and the son of sage Vishravasa, 
thus we hear. [1-20-17b, 18a]

"That formidable Ravana is not a devastator of rituals by himself, even so, two very mighty 
demons called Mareecha and Subaahu will cause devastating hindrances to rituals, instigated 
by him." Thus Sage Vishvamitra said to Dasharatha. [1-20-18b, 19]

Thus when he is said so by that sage Vishvamitra, then the king Dasharatha spoke to the sage, 
"I myself am not capable of standing against that evil minded Ravana, in truth, where is the 
question of deputing my young Rama to confront him? [1-20-20]

"You are the knower of probity, such as you are, you may please bestow benevolence upon my 
boyish son, as well on a less fortunate one like me too, and as our mentor you are indeed 
a god of ours. [1-20-21]

"Gods, demons, celestial beings like gandharva-s, yaksha-s, winged and reptile beings 
are incapable to bear the brunt of that Ravana in fight, why tell again about humans. [1-20-22]

"But that Ravana depletes the valour of valorous opponents in a battle, oh, eminent sage, 
either with my entire forces, or with all my sons I am inadequate to grapple with all his 
forces, or with him, individually. [1-20-23, 24a]

"My boyish son is godlike and unfledged in warfare, oh, Brahman, and he is the one who alleviates 
me from <font color="#B3003A">punnama naraka</font> the hell of sonless fathers... no, I cannot 
spare my son in anyway. [1-20-24b, 25a]

"Further, those saboteurs of your ritual namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are similar to Death-god 
and the descendents of the earliest demons and subverters of rituals, namely Sunda and Upasunda, 
no, I cannot spare my son, in any case. [1-20-25b, 26a]

"Mareecha and Subaahu are well-trained and valorous ones, hence I will proceed with all my 
friendly forces to war with either of those two demons, otherwise, I along with all my relatives 
implore upon you for your exoneration in my failure to comply my own promises. [1-20-26b, 
27]

Thus, by the incongruous talk of Dasharatha, the outstanding Brahman and son of Sage Kushi, 
namely sage Vishvamitra is overwhelmed with outrageous anger by his mentation, and that fire-like 
glorious sage looked like the ritual fire into which many inflammable oblations are offered, 
and which is drenched with a lot of clarified butter, whereby it is flaring up its tongues.

			When Vashishta said that way king Dasharatha with an air of satisfaction personally 
			fetched Rama along with Lakshmana. [1-22-1]

			Rama is blessed for a propitious travel firstly by his mother Kausalya and then 
			by his father king Dasharatha, thereupon the royal priest Vashishta rendered Vedic 
			hymns blessing the journey, then Dasharatha well pleased in his heart of hearts 
			kissed his son Rama on forehead and entrusted him to Vishvamitra. [1-22-2, 3]

			Then on seeing the lotus-eyed Rama following Vishvamitra, dustless 
			and pleasant for touch breeze blew. [1-22-4]

			When the great-souled Rama forged ahead there occurred an abounding downpour of 
			flowers with the booming of divine drums, together with the boom and blare of 
			drums and conch-shells of Ayodhya. [1-22-5]

			Rama with jet-black hair-locks handling his bow followed Vishvamitra who walked 
			ahead, while Lakshmana handling his own bow followed Rama. [1-22-6]

			Rama and Lakshmana, with two quivers each and two bows in their hands, and making 
			all the ten directions of compass lambent followed Vishvamitra, as if three headed 
			serpents followed Vishvamitra, and with their highly dynamic physiques and spiritedness 
			they look as if like the Ashwin twin gods of unequal charm following Brahma, the 
			Forefather. [1-22-7]

			Those two youngsters with charming and bejewelled physiques are handling bows 
			and swords and their fingers have leathern covers. Both the unreprovable brothers 
			Rama and Lakshmana are highly resplendent and effulgent by their worth. While 
			they are following Vishvamitra they looked like the sons of Fire-god, namely Skanda 
			and Vishakha, following the great god with inscrutable potential, namely Shiva, 
			and thus the brothers have made Vishvamitra to shine forth in even pose with god 
			Shiva. [1-22-8, 9, 10a]

			And on going one and half yojana distance Vishvamitra addressed Rama in a harmonious 
			voice calling, 'oh, Rama', on the southern riverbank of Sarayu. [1-22-10b, 11a]

			" "Take water, my boy, and like that you receive a group of hymns,
			<font color="#B3003A">bala</font> and <font color="#B3003A">atibala</font> from 
			me, and let no time lapse. [1-22-11b, 12a]

			"On receiving these hymns neither tiredness nor fever, nor disfiguring of personality 
			can effect you, nor the demons can charge you either you are sleeping or unvigilant. 
			[1-11-12b, 13a]

			"As it is none whosoever on earth can equal you in dexterity, Rama, and by reciting 
			these hymns none can equal you in the three worlds. [1-22-13b, 14a]

			"My dear Raghava, if bala atibala hymns are practised, oh, impeccable one, none 
			can equal you in the world by your handsomeness, calibre, erudition, by your discernment, 
			and even in replying or rebutting you. [1-22-14b, 15]

			"On receiving these two teachings there will be none similar to you, for bala 
			and atibala are the mothers of all knowledge. [1-22-16]

			"Oh, best one among men, Raghava, if you go on reciting bala and atiblala hymns, 
			my dear Rama, there will be no hunger or thirst to you. [1-22-17]

			"And if these twin teachings are practised an inestimable renown will also accrue, 
			oh, Raghu's legatee, these two hymns that possess brilliance are the daughters 
			of Forefather Brahma, and oh, Rama of Kakutstha, I intend to impart these hymns 
			to you, oh virtuous one, as you are the most eligible one, hence take the teachings 
			that are kept safe from the world. [1-22-18, 19a]

			"Though all of these numerous qualities are undoubtedly available with you, that 
			too in abundance, yet these hymns if ascetically nurtured will yield various results." 
			Thus spoke Sage Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-22-19b, 20a]

			Then Rama on touching water to purify himself received those teachings from the 
			contemplative soul Vishvamitra with gladness beaming on his face. [1-22-20b, 21a]

			Rama, the one with marvellous valiance, on obtaining those teachings performed 
			all his duties of a student in respect of a teacher and then shone forth like 
			the thousand rayed sun on a cloudless sky of autumn. Then those three very happily 
			stayed on the riverbank of Sarayu for that night. [1-22-21b, 22]

			Though both Rama and Lakshmana slept on an undeserving grass bed, nestled by the 
			comfortable words of Vishvamitra that night is as though pleasant to the noteworthy 
			children of Dasharatha. [1-22-24]

Sage Vishvamitra is the Seer for Gayatri hymn. He is the same Sage to impart <em>balaatibala</em> 
hymns to Rama and Lakshmana. For those readers that are interested to know or to practice, 
the Upanishad of <em>balaatibala</em> is included hereunder. This hymn is yet another 
aspect of Gayatri, and there is no hymn superior than Gayatri, <em>na gaayatryaaH

"Oh, enemy-chastener Rama, when the Divine Cow Shabala is spoken in this way by Sage Vashishta, then 
that milker bestowed each and every fancy, fancied by each and every fancier, according to one's own 
fancy." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shabala or Kaamadhenu, as a part of the legend 
of Vishvamitra to Rama and others. [1-53-1]

Shabala bestowed dishes of sugar cane and honey, and flakes of all sorts, like cornflakes, rice-flakes, 
also best arracks and liquors in best wineglasses, further, the drinks and foodstuffs that are very 
diverse and verily apposite to royalties and army-men. [1-53-2]

There emerged mountainous stacks of steamy foodstuffs, palatable side-dishes and desserts of rice 
etc., also the dumplings of cooked pulses, like that the cascades of curds and the other milk products 
like butter, ghee, cheese etc. Thousands of silver dishes and hollowware fully replete with daintily 
soft drinks, like that full with sugar-candy preparations, and with preparations that comprise all the 
six tastes have come up together with delectable foodstuffs made out of treacly dumplings of cane sugar. 
[1-53-3, 4]

Oh, Rama, all of the men in the forces of Vishvamitra, who are already rejoiced and regaled by the 
regular feasts accorded by their king Vishvamitra, are now comparatively well gladdened when feasted 
by Sage Vashishta, in which they rejoiced and regaled, for a good measure. [1-53-5]

Partaking that feast together with the best royal ladies of palace chambers, and with the court-scholars 
and the court-priests even the king Vishvamitra, who by his nature is a kingly sage, became exultant 
and energetic. [1-53-6]

When honoured along with his advisers, ministers and attendants by way of receiving a royal banquet, 
king Vishvamitra then in high admiration spoke this to Vashishta. [1-53-7]

You showed me a generous hospitality whereby I am esteemed by an estimable sage like you, oh, expert 
in sententiousness, now I wish to say for myself to which you may please listen. [1-53-8]

'Oh, godly sage, this Shabala may be given to me for a barter of a lakh, a hundred thousand, cows. 
Indeed this do-all cow is a treasure, and the kings are the gatherers of treasures. Therefore bestow 
this cow to me. As rule this cow also belongs to me.' Thus Vishvamitra said to Vashishta. [1-53-9, 10a]

When Vishvamitra addressed him in that way, the reverential sage Vashishta, who is a virtue-souled 
eminent saint, on his part replied the king in this way. [1-53-10b, 11a]

I cannot afford Shabala, neither by the barter of a hundred thousand cows, nor by hundreds of millions 
of cows, nor by lots and lots of silver, either. [1-53-11b, 12a]

Abandoning her from my proximity is unmeet for her, oh, enemy-subjugator, you cannot even subjugate 
me terroristically and try to wean this cow away from me, as Shabala is everlastingly and inseparably 
mine, as with the everlasting and inseparable respectability of a self-respectful person. [1-53-12b, 
13a]

This cow makes the journey of my life possible. Oblations to gods or manes, enkindling of Ritual-fire, 
religious sacrifices, <font color="#B3003A">homa</font>-s, the sacred rituals conducted as
<font color="#B3003A">darshapaurNamaasi</font>, all are dependent on her. [1-53-13b, 14a]

This cow is the bedrock for everything in its entirety, and regarding diverse and numerous indoctrinations, 
and even for add-on syllabics like <font color="#B3003A">svaahaa, vaSaT</font>, they are all dependent 
on this cow, there is no doubt about it. [1-53-14b 15a]

"In truth, this cow is everything to me and ever-gratifier, that way by so many reasons, oh, king, 
I cannot afford Shabala to you or to anyone." So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-53-15b, 16a]

Though Vashishta spoke thus Vishvamitra being an expert in sententiousness then spoke this sentence 
compellingly and argumentatively. [1-53-16b, 17a]

I bestow upon you fourteen thousand elephants adorned with golden girdles, golden necklets and golden 
goads. [1-53-17b, 18a]

I will grant you eight hundred golden chariots whichever can be yoked on with four whitely-white 
horses trimmed up with the sets of tintinnabulating bells. [1-53-18b, 19a]

I grant you, oh, superbly vowed sage, eleven thousand fleetly galloping horses of high pedigree born 
in best countries of best horse breeding. [1-53-19b, c]

I award ten million diversely coloured and differently divisionalized cows, whichever of them will 
be came of age as milker, thereby, let this do-all cow Shabala be given to me. [1-53-20]

"Or, oh, eminent Brahman, if you yearn either for gems or gold, I gift that much of everything as 
much as you can yearn, let Shabala be given to me." Thus Vishvamitra entreated again. [1-53-21]

When the shrewd king Vishvamitra spoke to the reverential sage Vashishta, that sage has clearly said, 
'whatever it is oh, king, I do not surrender Shabala, the cow.' [1-53-22]

Really this alone is my gemmy cow, thus I do not require your jewels or gems... truly, this alone 
is my treasure, thus I do not require your gilded chariots, horses or elephants... really, this alone 
is my everything, thus I need nothing from you... and actually, this alone is my alter-ego, thus you 
cannot separate me from myself. [1-53-23]

This alone is my <font color="#B3003A">darsha-puurNamaasa</font> rituals, and like that this alone 
is all my Vedic-rituals with worthwhile donations and oh, king, this essentially is of service in diverse 
activities of mine. [1-53-24]

" Oh, king, all of my activities are instated in this cow, then wherefore a lot of palavering a bargain 
or barter? I do not give away this milker any wish." So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra, and thus Sage 
Shataananda continued his narration of the legend of Sacred Cow. [1-53-25]

Sage Valmiki goes to river Tamasa for a bath and sees a couple of birds, of which a hunter 
kills one. Valmiki unintentionally utters a poem, which is rich in grammar and new in metre, 
of which he is very much confused as to why such a poem has come from his tongue. Brahma, 
the presiding deity of letters appears and ordains Valmiki to author Ramayana, excellent epic 
of Rama, for which purpose alone he gave such divine meter and grammar to him.

		Then, the great sage Valmiki, a skilled orator and a virtue-minded one, having heard those words of Narada, 
		worshipped him along with disciples. [1-2-1]

That divine sage Narada being worshipped befittingly by Valmiki in that way, on seeking 
permission of Valmiki to leave and having been permitted by Valmiki, went away heaven-ward. 
[1-2-2]

Then, on Narada's going to the world of gods in a trice, that sage Valmiki went to the banks of Tamasa river not far from Jahnavi river. [1-2-3]

Then that sage Valmiki on reaching the shore of the clean Tamasa, and on beholding a ford of that river, spoke to his disciple who was at his side. [1-2-4]

"Oh! Bharadwaja, behold this ford which is without dirt, with clear waters and pleasant like a virtuous man's mind. [1-2-5]

"My dear! Let the hand-vessel [kamaNDalu] be kept [there]. Let my bark-garment be given to me. I will enter this best 
ford of Tamasa only... [1-2-6]

Thus being said by the great-souled Valmiki, Bharadwaaja who was obedient to his Guru, gave the bark-garment to the sage [1-2-7]

That self-controlled Sage Valmiki on taking bark-garment from his disciple's hands, and looking in all directions, indeed moved away from that
wide expanse of forest. [1-2-8]

There holy sage Valmiki saw a couple of curlews, in the vicinity of that river's 
foreshore, flying there about in togetherness and cooing charmingly. [1-2-9]

A tribal hunter with evil intent, and a receptacle of enimity, killed the male 
one among the couple of birds, while Valmiki was looking on. [1-2-10]

The wife was moving together with husband with a red crest and with joy, with good wings, always being united with that male bird. On seeing
that bird slain on ground reeling with blood covered wings really made wailing sounds with piteous utterances on being separated from her 
husband. 
[1-2-11, 12]

On seeing that bird felled that way by the tribal hunter, compassion occassioned in that 
saintly sage Valmiki. [1-2-13]

Then on seeing the wailing female krounchi bird, out of state of compassion and apperceiving 
the killing of male bird as unjust, the sage uttered this sentence... [1-2-14]

"Oh! violent Hunter, by which reason you have killed one bird of the couple, when it 
was infatuated by passion, for that reason you will never get a state of rest for everlasting years to come..." 
[1-2-15]

Thus speaking and pondering in his heart, he became thoughtful: "What is this utterance by me in grief and anguish for this bird?". [1-2-16]

That great wise one who was an intellectual and the best among sages, on cogitating, made up his mind and also spoke these words to the 
disciple... [1-2-17]

"While I was tormented by grief, there arose a sentence consisting of four verses possessing metrically posited letters
suitable to be played as song and string music and that will be called Shloka, not otherwise..." [1-2-18]

Even the disciple happily received what that is articulated by the saint, a unique articulation, 
by which the saint too, was delighted. [1-2-19]

Then that saint on performing his bathing in that ford according to custom, and still thinking 
on the purport of his utterance, he returned towards his hermitage. [1-2-20]

Then Bharadwaja, the obedient disciple and an erudite scholar, for he heard and learnt many 
scriptures by listening, on taking handy-vessel full with water followed at the behind of 
his mentor. [1-2-21]

He that knower of dharma, Valmiki, having entered the threshold of hermitage along with disciples, 
and having seated spoke about the day-to-day teachings and also other things, but he himself 
is preoccupied in cogitation on the verse. [1-2-22]

Then, the great resplendent Four-faced creator of fourteen worlds, almighty Brahma, arrived 
there on his own, to see that eminent saint Valmiki. [1-2-23]

Then that pious saint Valmiki is highly surprised on seeing Brahma, and on quickly getting 
up from his seat with his palms adjoined humbly, he stood aside, as he is spellbind. [1-2-24]

Valmiki uninterruptedly venerated Brahma, on inquiring into his well-being, washed his feet, drenched his 
thirst, seated him to rest, and adored at best with customarily obeisance. [1-2-25]

Then god Brahma, who is seated on a high seat, very highly worshipped by Valmiki, also beckoned 
at Valmiki to take a seat. [1-2-26]

Even though Valmiki sat on his seat when duly permitted by Brahma, and though the Grandparent 
of the worlds is manifestly sitting before him, but the same broodings on those happenings 
occurred on that day have recurred on his mind. [1-2-27-28a]

"He that tribal hunter, who killed a cutely calling krouncha bird for no good reason than intending 
to capture the kill, is an evil souled one that caused hardship..." [1-2-28b-29a]

Remaining in melancholic mood Valmiki turned his mind to the depth of thinking, and again 
thinking only on the krouncha bird he sung the same verse, involuntarily. [1-2-29b-30a]

Then, Brahma smilingly spoke to that eminent saint Valmiki, "But, what that is composed is 
a verse only... and there is no need to think through... [1-2-30]

"Oh, Brahman, that speech of yours sprang forth at my wish alone, hence oh, eminent sage, 
you shall render the legend of Rama, in its entirety... [1-2-31]

"You shall narrate the legend of Rama, the virtuous, intellectual and an intrepid one, and 
a godlike person in this world as well, as you have heard it from sage Narada. [1-2-32]

"The adventures of valorous Rama along with Lakshmana, and the misadventures of demons, known 
or unknown in every detail, and even the plight of Vaidehi which is either revealed or un-revealed 
so far, and whatever legend that has happened, all that will also be known to you, even if 
it were to be unknown, as yet... [1-2-33-34]

"You shall versify the heart pleasing and merit-yielding legend of Rama, and not a single 
word of yours will not be false in this epic... [1-2-35]

"As long as the mountains and even rivers flourish on the surface of the earth, so long the 
legend of Ramayana will flourish in this world... [1-2-36]

"And as long as Rama's legend authored by you flourishes...till then you will flourish in 
heavenly, in netherworlds, and even in my abode, namely Abode of Brahma... [1-2-37]

On saying thus that Divinity Brahma vanished then and there only, and then that godly sage 
Valmiki came by astonishment, along with his disciples. [1-2-38]

Then all of the disciples of Valmiki sang this verse time and again very delightedly, and 
much astonished they also recited this verse, reciprocally. [1-2-39]

Equally lettered, four-footed is that verse when great Sage Valmiki articulated it, and when 
repetitively recited by one and all, it attained prominence as verse proper. [1-2-40]

Born is an intuition in that great sage and contemplated soul asserting that "I will compose 
entire Ramayana, the epic, in suchlike verses...' [1-2-41]

That celebrated sage and magnanimous seer Valmiki then authored the highly renowned Rama's 
legend extolling Rama's renown, with symmetrically worded verses, and words versified to yield 
meanings semantically, prosody free-flowing, and with hundreds of such verses. [1-2-42]

That epic contains uncomplicated compounds, conjunctions and conjugations, and has expressive 
sentences that are well knit and led evenly and sweetly, and that legend pertains to the best one 
from Raghu's dynasty, namely Rama, which also includes the extermination of the Ten headed evil 
named Ravana, and further, it is said by the sage, hence this may now be listened…&nbsp; [1-2-43]

			"When the god of gods Brahma left from there Bhageeratha stood on the 
			tip of his big-toe praying for the mercy of Lord Shiva for one year, 
			while that tip of his big-toe pressurised the earth." Thus Vishvamitra 
			continued his narration about Bhageeratha's effort to bring Ganga to 
			earth. [1-43-1]

			On completion of one year, he who is venerated by all worlds, the consort 
			of Uma and the god of animals from insects to humans, that god Shiva 
			revealed himself and spoke this to the king. [1-43-2]

			Oh, best one among humans, I am delighted with your unwavering effort, 
			and I will fulfil your cherish. I will therefore sustain Ganga, the 
			daughter of king of mountains by my head. [1-43-3]

			Afterwards, she who is reverenced by all the worlds and who is the 
			elder daughter of Himavanta, that Ganga assuming an unendurable form 
			and an insupportable rapidity, they say, then plunged from the sky onto 
			the auspicious head of Shiva. [1-43-4, 5a]

			She who is an extremely unendurable river that goddess Ganga even speculated 
			saying to herself, 'let me enter netherworld, indeed whisking Shiva 
			with my streams.' [1-43-5b, 6a]

			Discerning her egotism god Shiva is infuriated, and then on his part 
			that Three-eyed god Shiva thought to pent her up in the tufts of his 
			head-hair. [1-43-6b, 7a]

			And oh, Rama, she that holy River Ganga swooped down into the cavernous 
			curls of matted hair-tufts on the holy head of God Shiva, and she became 
			a detainee in them. [1-43-7b, 8a]

			Though she strove hard in one way or another to reach the earth that 
			Ganga is rendered incapable, as she could not gain access for an outlet 
			from any edge of the coils of matted hair-tufts of Shiva, hence she 
			is held there in durance vile. [1-43-8b, 9a]

			Goddess Ganga whirled round and round in the coils of tufts alone for 
			many number of years, and when Ganga's emanation from those coils is 
			intangible Bhageeratha again firmed up in a marvellous penance in the 
			matter of her descent to earth. [1-43-9b, 10a]

			Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, with that ascesis of Bhageeratha god 
			Shiva is very much delighted, and thereupon he has also released Ganga 
			aiming at Bindu Lake in Himalayas. [1-43-10b, 11a]

			While god Shiva released Ganga into Bindu Lake seven streams have emerged 
			out of it, and thus three auspicious Ganga-s with holy waters have cruised 
			eastward which are known as Hlaadini, Paavani, and Nalini. [1-43-11b, 
			12]

			Also thus Sucakshu, Seetha, and the excellent river Sindhu are the 
			other three rivers which streamed to the westward direction with their 
			holy waters. [1-43-13]

			Of them the seventh Ganga flowed towards the path of Bhageeratha' chariot, 
			and that great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting in a 
			divine chariot moved ahead and even Ganga followed him. [1-43-14, 15a]

			Thus Ganga came from heavens onto Shankara's head and from there onto 
			the earth, and there on earth her waters advanced with a tumultuous 
			sound advancing them. [1-43-15b, 16a]

			The earth then verily shone forth with the shoals of fish, schools 
			of tortoises, and scores of porpoises and other aquatic beings that 
			have already fallen and that are still falling in step with the spates 
			of Ganga. [1-43-16b, 17a]

			Later, they the gods, sages, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, and the assemblages 
			of siddha-s have then seen there the swoop of Ganga in that way from 
			heaven to earth, with curiosity. [1-43-17b, 18a]

			Some of the gods with aircrafts that are like cities in their shape 
			and size, and some with horses that are prancing, and some with best 
			elephants that are staggering, at the very sight of plunging Ganga, 
			have entered the firmament at that place. [1-43-18b, 19a]

			The gods whose animation is unlimited, and who are anxious to see the 
			plunge of Ganga, have come together in assemblages, which plunge is 
			a highest marvel in the universe by a better degree of her illimitable 
			animation than that of gods who came to see, and even benignant to the 
			world in according water and salving souls, which those gods cannot 
			do. [1-43-19b, 20a]

			"The glitter of the ornaments of hosts of gods who are in stampede, 
			made the cloudless sky to shine as if it is with a hundred of suns. 
			[1-43-20b, 21a]

			At that time, with the falling and rising of scores of porpoises and 
			reptiles, even with the wriggling fishes, the sky became flashy as if 
			flashes of lightning are strewn over it. [1-43-21b, 22a]

			Spattered innumerably with the whitish froth from the splashes of Ganga, 
			and stippled with the flights of swans, the sky is as though overspread 
			with silver-clouds of autumn. [1-43-22b, 23a]

			Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately, elsewhere sinuously, somewhere 
			else straightly, elsewhere sloppily, somewhere gushingly, and somewhere 
			else her cruise is leisurely and tardily. [1-43-23b, 24a]

			Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately in declivities, elsewhere 
			sinuously on zigzag lands, somewhere else straightly on uniform lands, 
			elsewhere sloppily in canting lands, somewhere gushingly in craggy lands, 
			and somewhere else her cruise is leisurely in flatlands and tardily 
			in uplands.

			Somewhere her water repeatedly knocking against her own water is recurrently 
			billowing upwards only to make nosedive onto earth. [1-43-24b, 25a]

			That impeccable and immaculate water of Ganga then became outstanding 
			as it has flounced down from heaven primarily onto the head of Shankara, 
			and therefrom it has coasted down onto the earth. [1-43-25b, 26a]

			And asserting that the water as holy, because it descended touching 
			the body of Shiva, viz., the head of Shiva, the assemblages of sages, 
			gandharva-s, and those that are residents on the plane of earth have 
			sipped that water at that place. [1-43-26b, 27a]

			Also those that have fallen from heaven onto the surface of earth by 
			some curse or the other, they too became blemishless on taking head-bath 
			in the water of Ganga. [1-43-27b, 28a]

			When sins are washed away with the hallowing water of Ganga, they again 
			transited skyward and then obtained their own empyrean worlds once again. 
			[1-43-28b, 29a]

			With her splendorous water people are blissful, and on taking dip-baths 
			in Ganga they are totally removed of the strains of their sins, and 
			they lived blissfully ever after. [1-43-29b, 30a]

			In this way, the great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting 
			in a divine chariot continuously moved ahead and Ganga continually followed 
			him at his behind. [1-43-30b, 31a]

			Oh, Rama, all of the gods along with the assemblages of sages, ogres, 
			monsters, demons, and even great reptiles with kinnara-s, and gandharva-s 
			with best yaksha-s, and even serpents and apsara-s, have delightfully 
			moved after Ganga who is following the chariot of Bhageeratha, and why 
			they, in fact, all of the aquatic beings have followed Ganga. [31b, 
			32, 33a]

			In whichever direction king Bhageeratha has advanced, that glorious 
			River Ganga, who is the prominent river among all the rivers and the 
			complete obliterator of sins, has also moved at his behind in that direction. 
			[1-43-33b, 34a]

			While in flow she started to completely inundate the field of Vedic-ritual 
			belonging to the great-souled sage Jahnu, who is of marvellous deeds 
			and who is presently an officiator of an ongoing Vedic-ritual. [1-43-34b, 
			35a]

			But on knowing her hubris, oh, Raghava, that sage Jahnu has become 
			irritated and causing an extreme marvel he drank off all the water of 
			Ganga. [1-43-35b, 36a]

			Thereupon, the gods along with gandharva-s and sages at that extremely 
			marvellous feat of Sage Jahnu are highly astounded, and they then started 
			to worship that ablest human and great-souled sage Jahnu, and even deigned 
			for the daughterhood of Ganga to that high-souled sage Jahnu. [1-43-36b, 
			37]

			That greatly radiant and godly sage Jahnu is then delighted and released 
			Ganga from both of his ears. Therefore Ganga became the daughter of 
			sage Jahnu, and she is also renowned as Jahnavi, after the name of that 
			sage. [1-43-38]

			Even though Ganga again proceeded moving behind the chariot of Bhageeratha 
			and reached the ocean, therefrom she had to wend her way to netherworld, 
			once dug by the sons of Sagara, only to accomplish the mission of Bhageeratha, 
			namely drenching the ashes of Sagara's sons. [1-43-39, 40a]

			Even kingly-sage Bhageeratha making every effort ushered Ganga to netherworld, 
			but on seeing his grandparents rendered to ashes he has became doleful. 
			[1-43-40b, 41a]

			"Oh, Rama, the best of Raghu's dynasty, then Ganga inundated that mound 
			of ashes of Sagara's six-thousand sons, by which those souls obtained 
			heaven, while the sins of souls are cleansed with the water of Ganga." 
			Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-43-41b, c]

			"Oh, Rama, Lady Diti was highly anguished for those sons that are killed 
			and said this to her husband, Sage Kashyapa, the son of Sage Maareechi." 
			Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. [1-46-1]

			Oh, god, I am bereaved of my sons who are killed by your great mighty 
			sons, the sons of your second wife Aditi, as such I wish to bear a son, 
			who is achievable by sustained penance, for he shall be the exterminator 
			of Indra. [1-46-2]

			'Such a bereaved mother as I am, I wish to undertake asceticism for 
			a son who shall become an exterminator of Indra, and who shall be the 
			ruler of worlds. As such, it will be apt of you to permit me for asceticism, 
			and further it will be apt of you to accord me pregnancy with such a 
			son.' Thus Diti spoke to her husband Kaashyapa. [1-46-3]

			On hearing her request the great resplendent sage Kaashyapa, the son 
			of Sage Mareechi, replied Diti, who is deeply mournful. [1-46-4]

			" 'So be it... oh, ascetically wealthy lady, you be blest, if you abide 
			by the propriety of the practises of asceticism, then you will be delivering 
			a son who can become an exterminator of Indra in war. [1-46-5]

			'If you can complete a thousand years of asceticism punctiliously, 
			by my grace you can deliver a son who can be a husbander of three worlds.' 
			Thus Sage Kaashyapa advised his wife Diti. [1-46-6]

			Saying thus that great resplendent sage patted her, and then on his 
			touching her she is consecrated, and then that sage Kaashyapa departed 
			for his ascetic practises, saying 'be blest.' [1-46-7]

			On the exit of Sage Kaashyapa, oh, best one among men Rama, highly 
			elated Diti reached the sacred place called Kushaplava, on which the 
			present City of Vishala is now standing, and practised a highly rigorous 
			asceticism. [1-46-8]

			While she is truly practising asceticism, oh, the best among men Rama, 
			that Thousand-eyed god Indra has indeed rendered services with his abundant 
			and surpassing veracities to her, who is none other than his maternal-aunt. 
			[1-46-9]

			The Thousand-eyed god Indra made available fire, firewood, water, the 
			sacred Kusha grass, fruits and like that tubers also, and whatever other 
			items she required in her ascetic practise. [1-46-10]

			All the time Indra indeed served Diti by massaging her body, and other 
			means of removing her bodily strain resulting from her arduous practises. 
			[1-46-11]

			Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, when ten years are less to complete 
			the thousand years span of her ascetics, Diti is highly rejoiced as 
			her ambition is going to fructify in just ten more years, and then she 
			spoke to the Thousand-eyed god, Indra. [1-46-12]

			Oh, best one among the valiant ones, Indra, to me who am practising 
			asceticism ten years are remaining to complete, then you can see your 
			brother, you be safe. [1-46-13]

			Oh, son Indra, whom I am bringing up for your reason, I will bring 
			him up as a victory-enthusiast, and oh, son, Indra, along with him conquering 
			the three worlds you can enjoy them, without febrility from your enemies.

			Oh, son Indra, whom I am now bringing up, will be enthusiastic in 
			conquering you, but somehow I will manage him by telling that you are 
			after all his brother, and no harm shall be done to you, and oh, son 
			Indra, if you join him you will get rid of your febrility, caused by 
			his emergence, and then you two can conquer all the three worlds. [1-46-14]

			Oh, best one among gods, Indra, on my prayer your high-souled father 
			Sage Kaashyapa bestowed this boon on me for a son, which materialises 
			at the end of thousand years, and only ten more years are to slip by. 
			[1-46-15]

			When Diti was saying thus, the noontime sun was reigning high that 
			lady is stolen over by sleep keeping her feet headward. [1-46-16]

			On observing her who has become impious by placing her head at feet-side 
			and braid falling on feet, Indra is gladdened and laughed at her failed 
			asceticism. [1-46-17]

			Oh, Rama, being a highly courageous one, Indra the destroyer of enemy 
			fastnesses, entered the body of Diti through her vaginal aperture and 
			rent her foetus asunder into seven fragments. [1-46-18]

			Oh, Rama, then that foetus wailed clamorously while being sliced with 
			Thunderbolt that has hundred cutting edges, and then Diti woke up. [1-46-19]

			'Do not scream, do not scream...' thus Indra was coaxing the foetus, 
			and even though that foetus is screaming piteously the great resplendent 
			Indra has gone on fragmenting it. [1-46-20]

			'Unkillable, unkillable is my foetus...' thus Diti raved in that way, 
			and then Indra fell out of the womb honouring his stepmother's entreaty. 
			[1-46-21]

			Indra humbly folding his palms that are still handling his bloody Thunderbolt 
			spoke to Diti, 'oh, lady, you have become impious when your braid touched 
			your feet and when you have gone to sleep in midday, and you vow is 
			thwarted.' [1-46-22]

			"Thereby I gained a chance to eliminate him who can eliminate Indra 
			in a battle. Hence I fragmented your foetus into seven fragments, and 
			it will be apt of you to pardon me for that act of mine." So said 
			Indra to lady Diti. Thus, Sage Vishvamitra continued narration about 
			City of Vishaala. [1-46-23]

On hearing the words of that unfaltering sage about demoness Tataka, Raghava, best 
man's son who is firm in his vows, reverently adjoining his palms replied the sage. 
[1-26-1]

"Upon my father's order, upon my honour to my father's word, and looking upon this 
as the word of sage Kushi's son, my mentor, this task is definitely to be implemented. 
[1-26-2]

"What my great souled father Dasharatha directed me to do among elders in Ayodhya, 
that word too cannot be disregarded. [1-26-3]

"Such as I am, I will undertake the primary duty of eliminating Tataka, according 
as the follower of father's words, and according to the instruction of a Brahma 
scholar, such as your are, without a doubt. [1-26-4]

"I am ready to effectuate the bidding of an inestimable sage like you, for the welfare 
of cows and Brahmans, and for the advantage of this province." So said Rama to sage 
Vishvamitra. [1-26-5]

Saying thus, Rama, the enemy-destroyer, clenched his left fist on the handgrip in 
the middle of the bow, and with the right he made a thunderous sound of the bowstring 
making all the directions to blast. [1-26-6]

By that sound the inhabitants of Tataka forest are startled, and even Tataka is 
stupefied by that sound, and she is intolerably infuriated at it. [1-26-7]

She who is convulsed in anger to hear that sound gave attention to the direction 
wherefrom it emerged and she rancorously rushed thereto. [1-26-8]

Raghava on seeing that monstrous-looking demoness with a distorted face and who 
by proportions is very gigantic, furthermore infuriated, spoke to Lakshmana. [1-26-9]

"Lakshmana, see that yakshii's grisly and ghastly physique, seeing which hearts 
of cowards are prone to burst. [1-26-10]

" She is unstoppable and has magical powers, is't, you may see now how I will make 
her to readily retreat by lopping off her ears and the tip of nose. [1-26-11]

"As it is her femininess is protecting her, and I too I do not really attempt 
to kill her, but I intend to terminate her impudence and mobility. [1-26-12]

While Rama is still speaking that way, convulsed in anger Tataka roaringly rushed 
towards Rama alone, swinging her arms. [1-26-13]

But the Brahma-sage Vishvamitra daunted sounded her off and said to Rama and Lakshmana, 
"let you be safe, and be victorious." [1-26-14]

Flinging up dreadful dust on those two Raghavaa-s, Tataka baffled them for a while 
with a massive cloud of dust. [1-26-15]

Then taking hold of witchery she inundated both the Raghava-s with highly torrential 
stone rain, by which Rama became indignant. [1-26-16]

On forestalling her effusive stone storming with his arrow storm, Rama even mutilated 
both of her arms with arrows while she rushed towards them. [1-26-17]

With her arms severed and fatigued she started to roar extremely at the nearby, 
and then provoked Lakshmana made her to loose her ears and the tip of nose by cutting 
them off. [1-26-18]

That guise changer vanished after variously altering her aspects, and then on baffling 
them with her illusoriness and discharging stone storms she moved about appallingly. 
[1-26-19, 20a]

And on seeing both Rama and Lakshmana who are being overspread by storms of stones 
from all-over, then the illustrious sage Vishvamitra spoke this sentence. [1-26-20b, 
21a]

"Enough is your compassion Rama, she is a sinister, behaviourally malevolent, a 
hinderer of rituals, and this yakshii gets a grip on herself in a short time by 
her illusory powers. [1-26-21b, 22a]

"Sun is going to set in a short time, and only before that time she shall be destroyed, 
for demons at dusk and afterwards become unassailable, indeed." So said sage Viswamitra 
to Rama. [1-26-22b, 23a]

When Vishvamitra addressed him thus, Rama displaying his capacity in sonic archery 
forestalled that yakshii who has gone into invisibility and storming stone-storms, 
with his arrows. [1-26-23b, 24a]

And when the arrays of arrows obstructed her who possesses illusional powers, she 
dashed towards Rama and Lakshmana blaring stridently. [1-26-24b, 25a]

And Rama struck an arrow in her chest who is invading and speedily swooping down 
like a thunderbolt, and thus she is readily felled down and totally dropped dead, 
too. [1-26-25b, 26a]

On seeing her who is horrendous in her shape is  eliminated, Indra and other gods 
have highly esteemed Rama saying, admirable, admirable is this act. [1-26-26b, 
27a]

The thousand eyed and the destroyer of enemy?s citadels Indra then spoke with high 
satisfaction, and even all of the gods are gladdened and said to Vishvamitra this 
way. [1-26-27b, 28a]

"Oh, sage Vishvamitra, you are blessed, all the groups of wind-gods along with Indra 
are pleased, so you please show more concern for Raghava. [1-26-28b, 29a]

"The sons of Prajapati Krishasva who are valiant by their virtue and who possess 
ascetic strength, oh, Brahman, they may be offered to Raghava. [1-26-29b, 30a]

"Rama is steadfast in following your assignments and thus he is the worthy receiver 
of those missiles, and this prince has to accomplish a very great deed of gods. 
So said gods to Vishvamitra. [1-26-30b, 31a]

All the gods on saying thus and on extolling Vishvamitra they contentedly returned 
to heavens, and then the sunset has come to pass. [1-26-31b, 32a]

That best sage is satisfied with Rama and gladdened for the eradication of Tataka 
kissed the forehead of and then said this sentence. [1-26-32b, 33a]

"Here we stay for tonight, Rama, the august one for a gaze, and tomorrow morning 
we will go to that hermitage of mine. So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-26-33b, 34a]

On listening sage Vishvamitra's words, Dasharatha's son Rama, comfortably stayed 
that night there in that forest of Tataka. [1-26-34]

On that very day alone that forest of Tataka too is released from the curse, and 
it shone forth like the luxurious heavenly garden of Kubera, namely Chiatra Ratha. 
[1-26-35b, c]

Rama while being eulogised by the groups of celestials and liberated Souls for complete 
elimination of yaksha's daughter, namely Tataka, stayed there along with the sage 
only to be awakened by the next day's sunrise. [1-26-36]

"Vishvamitra, the son of Kushi, piteously spoke this mellowly sentence to king Trishanku who spoke thus, 
and who in reality attained a state of profaner." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-59-1]

Oh, Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s, you are welcome. I am aware that you are a highly righteous 
king. Oh, the best king, you need not be dismayed, for I accord you haven. [1-59-2]

I will invite all the sages with pious activities who will render assistance in the ritual, oh, king, 
then you can perform the ritual self-composedly. [1-59-3]

You can go to heaven with this body of yours, as well as with the form which is deformed by the curse 
of mentor Vashishta through his sons. [1-59-4]

'I deem that heaven is handy to you, oh, king of subjects, as you have approached the all-sheltering 
Vishvamitra and sought shelter.' Thus Vishvamitra solaced Trishanku. [1-59-5]

On saying thus to Trishanku that great-resplendent Vishvamitra ordered his highly righteous and astutely 
brilliant sons to organise the arrangements for the ritual. [1-59-6]

Vishvamitra calling forth all of his disciples said this sentence, 'oh boys invite all the eminent sages who 
are well-read in many Veda-s, along with their disciples and friends, and their ritwiks, the conductors 
of rituals at my order.' [1-59-7, 8a]

'If someone speaks inconsiderately incited by the forcefulness of my word, whoever speaks it, whichever 
word it may be, all that is to be reported to me, whatever it is.' Thus Vishvamitra ordered his disciples. 
[1-59-8]

On listening that word of Vishvamitra his disciples went to all directions inviting all by his order, 
and then the Vedic scholars started to arrive from all provinces. [1-59-9 b, 10a]

All of the disciples have returned to the fulgently resplendent sage Vishvamitra, and reported the 
words spoken by all the Vedic scholars. [1-59-10b, 11a]

'On listening your word all the Brahmans from all provinces have started to come and some have already 
come, leaving alone Mahodaya, the son of Vashishta.' Thus, the disciples have started to inform Vishvamitra. 
[1-59-11b, 12a]

What all said by those hundred sons of Vashishta is explosively worded in their fury, oh, eminent 
sage, and what all they have said that you may please listen. [1-59-12b, 13a]

'A Kshatriya is the officiator, and a profaner is the performer. How then the gods or sages can partake 
of the remnants of oblations in that ritual-assembly, especially that of a profaner?' Thus, the sons 
of Vashishta exclaimed. [1-59-13b, 14a]

Though the Brahmans or the high-souled sages are now embarrassed by Vishvamitra, how can they go 
to heaven even after their demise, partaking of the food of a profaner? [1-59-14b, 15a]

'Oh, tigerly sage Vishvamitra, all the sons of Vashishta including Mahodaya spoke these derisive sentences 
with their eyes reddening in anger.' Thus, the disciples reported to Vishvamitra. [1-59-15b, 16a]

The eminent sage Vishvamitra having heard those words of the sons of Vashishta from all of his disciples, 
said this rancorously with bloodshot eyes. [1-59-16b, 17a]

He who reproves me, who am abiding in rigorous ascesis, and who am an unreprovable one by my ascetic 
merit, that irreverent person will be reduced to ashes, and there is no doubt about it. [1-59-17b, 18a]

Now they will be dragged by the lasso of Time to the House of Yama, the Terminator, and from now 
to seven hundred births to come they take birth as devourers of corpses, come what may. [1-59-18b, 19a]

Those who reprove me will be wandering about these mortal worlds on taking birth as disfigured and 
deformed beings in the ruthless sect of Mustika-s that always feed on dog's flesh. [1-59-19b, 20a]

That wrong-headed Mahodaya also reproached me, who am irreproachable on my part, hence he gets into 
tribal-hood and becomes a reproachable tribal for the entire world. [1-59-20b, 21a]

By my fury he obtains an utter barbarity and he will be occupied with a murderous bent, and he cycles 
through a worst possible living for a long time. [1-59-21b, 22a]

On saying this much sentence of curse among the sages who have already arrived, that great-resplendent, 
greatly ascetic, great sage Vishvamitra paused. [1-59-22]

"Oh, tigerly man Rama, on giving farewell to those sages who came at his invitation 
and who have started to go back after the ritual of Trishanku is over, then that 
great-resplendent Vishvamitra spoke to all of the sages who are forest dwellers 
that remained with him." Thus Shatananda continued to narrate the legend of Vishvamitra. 
[1-61-1]

While depending on this southern quarter this gross hindrance has cropped up 
for my ascesis in the shape of Trishanku's ascent to heaven, hence we will go to 
another direction, and there we continue ascesis. [1-61-2]

'Oh, great-souled sages, we can conveniently undertake our ascesis in the vast 
of westerly direction where holy lakesides are there. That would be an august ascetical 
forest, isn't it.' Thus Vishvamitra said to fellow sages in his camp. [1-61-3]

On saying thus that most brilliant and great saint Vishvamitra performed an unhindered 
and rigorous ascesis subsisting only on fruits and tubers after reaching the lakeside 
of holy lakes. [1-61-4]

In the meanwhile the great king of Ayodhya, renowned as Ambariisha, embarked on 
to perform a Vedic-ritual. [1-61-5]

But Indra impounded the animal of the principal of that ritual, namely king Ambariisha, 
and when that animal is really vanished, the officiant Brahman of the ritual spoke 
this to that king. [1-61-6]

Oh, king, the animal you have fetched for the ritual has gone astray owing to 
your incautiousness. Oh, king, unguarded items of the ritual will themselves become 
destructive blemishes for that king who is performing the ritual. [1-61-7]

'Oh, the best man among men, you have to make great amends for the loss of animal 
as that animal alone which was intended but now missing shall be used in ritual. 
Or, a man may be fetched as ritual-animal, and only after that the deeds of the 
ritual can be continued.' Thus, the priests of the ritual said to king Ambariisha. 
[1-61-8]

On hearing the words of his teacher, oh, the best one among men, Rama, he that 
highly rule-obedient king tried for a human-ritual-animal for a barter of thousands 
of cows. [1-61-9]

While that king is searching those and those provinces, villages, forests, townships, 
and even the pious hermitages, oh, dear Rama, the legatee of Raghu's dynasty, that 
king has indeed seen Sage Riciika, who is well settled on Mt. Bhrigutunga along 
with his sons and wife. [1-61-10, 11]

On reverencing and on obtaining the grace of ascetically brilliant great Sage Riciika, 
and even on asking him about his wellbeing in every aspect, that kingly sage Ambariisha, 
who is with great resplendence and whose brilliance is illimitable, said this word 
to that sage. [1-61-12, 13a]

Oh, godlike sage, if you bargain your son with a hundred thousand cows for the 
purpose of a ritual-animal, oh, the successor Sage Bhrigu, I deem my ends are achieved. 
[1-61-13b, 14a]

'All the provinces are went over but unobtainable is that animal of the ritual, 
hence it will be apt of you to give me one son from among your sons, for a value.' 
Thus, king Ambariisha bargained with the sage. [1-61-14b, 15a]

When that great-resplendent Sage Riciika is addressed thus, he said this word, 
'oh, best of men, I cannot possibly sell my eldest son, in anyway.' [1-61-15b, 16a]

On hearing the words of Sage Riciika the mother of those great-souled sons spoke 
this word to the tigerly-man Ambariisha. [1-61-16b, 17a]

The most reverential sage and the one from Bhaargava dynasty, my husband, said 
that the eldest son is un-sellable. Thereof oh, lord, you must know that my youngest 
son, namely Shunaka, is a cherished one for me. Therefore oh, king, I will not give 
my youngest son to you, either. [1-61-17b, 18]

 'Generally eldest sons are fathers' favourites, oh, best king among men, and mothers' 
favourites are the youngest, isn't it! Therefor, I have to tend my youngest son.' 
Thus, wife Sage Ruciika said to Ambariisha. [1-61-19]

Oh, Rama, when that sage's sentence is so, and his wife's sentence is also in that 
way only, their intermediate son, namely Shunashepa, personally spoke this sentence. 
[1-61-20]

Father said that the eldest son is un-sellable, mother also said the same about 
youngest one. Then I deem that the intermediary son is sellable. Hence, oh, prince, 
you may lead me forth. [1-61-21]

Oh, dextrous Rama, when that advocate of Veda-s, namely Shunashepa finished his 
speech, then the king gave gold, silver, and gemstones, each in ten million heaps, 
and even a hundred thousand cows, and oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that king Ambariisha 
went away highly gladdened to take Shunashepa with him. [1-61-22, 23]

"That great resplendent and highly renowned king Ambariisha on his part proceeded 
hastily after ascending Shunashepa onto the chariot that hastily." Thus Sage Shataananda 
continued his narration. [1-61-24]

			On becoming personally purified Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha-s,

			"Oh, godly sage, I have taken the missiles and became unassailable even

			too." So said Rama to the sage. [1-28-2]

			Thus Vishvamitra gave missiles to Rama. [1-28-4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

			Gladdening in his heart of hearts Rama of Kakutstha received the annulment 
			missiles saying, "Agreed! Sire!" Those missiles are with radiantly divine 
			bodies, appealing and endowing bliss. Some are fire-like, some smoke-like, 
			and some moon-like and some sun-like, and such as they are, some of 
			them holding out their hollowed palms, and some with palms adjoined 
			melodiously spoke to Rama saying, "here we are, oh, tigerly man, what 
			can we do for you." [1-28-11, 12, 13]

			"While remaining in my memory you assist me as and when needed, and 
			till then you may go away as you wish," thus that legatee of Raghu-s said 
			to those deities of annulment missiles. [1-28-14]

			Saying "it will be done that way" to Rama, the legatee of Kakutstha-s, 
			also on performing circumambulation to him and then on taking his consent 
			those deities have gone away as they have come. [1-28-15]

			After learning the nullifying missiles and then while proceeding on 
			the walkway Raghava asked the great sage Vishvamitra with sweet and 
			soft words. [1-28-16]

			"What is this cloudlike picturesque thicket shining forth not very far 
			away on this side of mountain, with animals spreading over it, and embellished 
			with numerous kinds of birds that have pleasant callings it is highly 
			soul-delighting, thus, my inquisitiveness is growing very much to know 
			it, what is this, really! [1-28-17, 18]

			"By the nature of happy environs at this place, oh, eminent sage, I 
			understand that we have come out of the extremely alarming forest of 
			Tataka, but oh, god, whose hermitage's threshold is this, kindly tell 
			me all. [1-28-19]

			"Oh, great saint, where are those murderers of Brahmans? Oh, venerable 
			one, at which place those evil minded sinners and evildoers will be 
			coming to hinder your ritual? And where, oh, Brahman, I have to safeguard 
			your ritual ceremonies, and demons too are to be eliminated? Oh, eminent 
			sage, what is that place? I would like to hear all of it." Rama asked 
			Vishvamitra in that way. [1-28-20b, 21, 22]

When Brahmadatta has married and left, oh, Raghava, king Kushanaabha he embarked 
on Vedic-ritual called <font color=" #B3003A">putrakaameSThi</font> in order to 
beget a son because is sonless. [1-34-1]

During the performance of the ritual, supremely generous Kusha, the brainchild of 
Brahma and the father of Kushanaabha, spoke to the king Kushanaabha. [1-34-2]

" 'Oh, son, there will be a highly virtuous and selfsame son of yours, known as 
Gaadhi, and through him you also will get everlasting renown in the world.' " Thus 
Kusha said to Kushanaabha. [1-34-3]

"Saying so, oh, Rama, Kushanaabha's father Kusha entered the sky and journeyed to 
the time-honoured abode of Brahma. [1-34-4]

"Then after some time that highly intellectual Kushanaabha begot a supremely righteous 
son known by the name Gaadhi. [1-34-5]

"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, that eminently righteous Gaadhi is my father, and 
since I am born in Kusha dynasty, oh, Raghu's legatee, I got the name Kaushika." 
Sage Vishvamitra thus narrating to Rama. [1-34-6]

"Even my elder sister who undertook benevolent vows and who is renowned by her name 
Satyavathi is there, oh, Raghava, and she is given in marriage to sage Ruchika. 
[1-34-7]

"She journeyed to heaven with her body while she followed her departed husband and 
being a very generous lady she coursed as a great river renowned as River Kaushiki. 
[1-34-8]

"Desiring to yield benefit for the welfare of world, my sister has emerged with 
her divinely pious and delightful waters, taking recourse to Himalayan Mountains. 
[1-34-9]

"Thereby, oh, Rama, I am delightfully and abidingly residing on the mountainsides 
of Himalayas, in adjacency of my sister Kausiki in all my affection for her. [1-34-10]

"She that Satyavathi for her part is a pious one, steadfast in truthfulness and 
righteousness, a husband devote, and such a highly fortunate one has emerged as 
a best river among rivers, namely River Kaushiki. [1-34-11]

"Owing to my vow, oh, Rama, I left her for a while and came to the Accomplished 
Hermitage and owing to your magnificence I have become accomplished in that vow 
of mine. [1-34-12]

"Oh, dextrous Rama, this is all about my dynasty, my province on which we are presently 
camping namely the riverbanks of Sona, and about my birth, and thus everything is 
narrated as you have asked me. [1-34-13]

"By telling these legends it is past midnight, oh, Kakutstha, you get some sleep. 
Safe you be! Let no hindrance occur for us halfway on our pathway. [1-34-14]

"Oh, Raghu's delight, trees are standstill... animals and birds have slouched... 
nightly sombre has pervaded all the confines. [1-34-15]

"Eventide lapsed slowly and the vault of heaven filled with stars and starlets is 
splendorous as though orbs of heaven are overspread on its vault. [1-34-16]

"Also, dissipating the darkness of the world with his brilliance, the moon with 
coolant moonbeams is rising up, gladdening the hearts of worldly beings. [1-34-17]

"Now, the bands of yaksha-s, demons, even the ferocious ogres that feed on raw flesh, 
why them, all the beings that take pleasure in nights are astir, far and wide." 
So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-34-18]

Saying so that greatly resplendent and eminent saint Vishvamitra paused, and then 
all the other sages have revered him saying, "well-said, well-said." [1-34-19]

"Sublime is this lineage of Kusha dynasty which always dedicated itself to righteousness, 
and the dynasty of Kusha are the best ones among mankind, and they symbolise with 
god Brahma himself, thus they are highly reverential." Thus the other sages have 
applauded Vishvamitra and his dynasty. [1-34-20]

"You alone are exemplarily selfsame to Brahma, oh, Vishvamitra of great-renown, 
and among rivers that prominent River Kaushiki is your sister, thus she is glorifying 
your ancestry." Thus the sages lauded Vishvamitra. [1-34-21]

Sage Vishvamitra is pleased when those tigerly sages have laude him, and then that 
magnificent sage Vishvamitra lapsed into the lap of sleep, as the sun lapses into 
lap of dusk for that day. [1-34-22]

Even Rama with a little astonishment coming upon him, applauding that tigerly-sage, 
and glided into the lap of sleep along with Soumitri. [1-34-23]

"Oh, Raghava, on making that great-souled Vashishta an enemy, whenever Vishvamitra 
reminisced over his subdual by Vashishta, he is seethed at heart and heaved sighs 
repeatedly. Then on going to southern quarter with his prime queen, that great-ascetic 
Vishvamitra self-collectedly conducted a highly astounding ascesis subsisting only 
on fruits and tubers." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra's 
legend. [1-57-1, 2, 3a]

Then Vishvamitra begot sons named Havispanda, Madhuspnada, Dhridhanetra and Mahaaratha, 
who conduct themselves in candour and chivalry. [1-57-3]

At the close of one thousand years of ascesis Brahma, the Grandparent of all worlds, 
revealed Himself to Vishvamitra and spoke these words mellowly to ascetically wealthy 
Vishvamitra, 'oh, son of Kushika, Vishvamitra, you have won the worlds of kingly-sages 
by your ascesis.' [1-57-4b, 5]

'We indeed acquiesce you as a kingly-sage by your ascesis.' saying so that great 
resplendent Brahma, the Supreme Ruler of the Worlds, went away to his Abode of Brahma, 
while the gods in Brahma's convoy went to Indra's Heaven. [1-57-6, 7a]

On hearing that Vishvamitra is down-faced with disgrace, and while high anguish 
prevailed over him, he rancorously soliloquised this. [1-57-7b, 8a]

'Even though I have practised a very high ascesis, the gods together with the 
observances of hermits are recognising me just as a 'kingly-sage.' Thereby I deem 
that there is no fruition to my ascesis.' Thus Vishvamitra thought. [8b, 9a]

Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, deciding in this way in his heart of hearts that self-willed 
Vishvamitra again undertook a supreme ascesis as he is a great-ascetic. [1-57-9]

In this meantime there is a veracious king named Trishanku, an enhancer of 
Ikshvaku dynasty, and one renowned for his self-conquest. [1-57-10b, 11a]

Oh, Raghava, an idea sprang up in the mind of Trishanku to perform a ritual 
by which he will go to heaven with his own body. Then he sincerely invited Vashishta 
and told him what his thinking is. [1-57-11b, 12]

But the great-souled Vashishta said it as impossible. Thus repudiated Trishanku 
went to southerly direction in search of orchestrators for the purpose of realising 
that task, such a phantasmal ritual that enables him to go to heaven with his body, 
and that king has gone to the sons of Vashishta. [1-57-13, 14a]

Trishanku has indeed gone to the place where the sons of Vashishta are protractedly 
expiating, and there he visited the hundred noble-souled sons of Vashishta, who 
are supremely self-luminescent and superbly self-refulgent by their ascesis. [1-57-14b, 
15]

On reaching nigh of those noble-souled sons of the indoctrinator, namely Vashishta, 
Trishanku reverenced all of them sequentially according to their age, but with a 
little down- faced owing to abashment, and spoke to all of those great-souled ones 
making palm-fold in supplication. [1-57-16]

I have come as a shelter-seeker seeking the shelter of yours as you are the shelterers 
of the needy, you all be safe, as the great-souled Vashishta has repudiated me. 
[1-57-17b, 18a]

I am longing to perform an unusual ritual and it will be apt of you to give assent 
to it. Reverencing all of the sons of my mentor Vashishta I am proposing this to 
you. [1-57-18b, 19]

With reverence I truckle before you all Brahmans who are abiding in ascesis. 
Such as you are I beg you to assiduously get a ritual performed through me, as to 
how I can get to heaven with my body. [1-57-19b, 20]

Oh, ascetically wealthy Brahmans, as I am repudiated by Vashishta, I do not perceive 
another recourse excepting you, who are all the sons of mentor Vashishta. [1-57-21]

" 'The Priest is the ultimate recourse for all of the kings in Ikshvaku dynasty, 
isn't it. Therefore, next to Vashishta you are all the next-best gods to me.' Thus 
Trishanku entreated the hundred sons of Sage Vashishta." Sage Shataananda thus continued 
narration. [1-57-22]

"Diti was highly anguished when her foetus is rendered into sevenfold, and spoke these 
appeasing words to the indomitable Thousand-eyed Indra." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about 
City Vishala. [1-47-1]
 'Oh, Indra, the eliminator of demon Bala, this foetus of mine is sliced into seven 
segments owing to my own misdeed, oh, ruler of gods, Indra, indeed there is no iniquity of yours in 
this matter.' Thus Diti started speaking to Indra. [1-47-2]
Though a reversal has happened against my thinking in the matter of my pregnancy, 
let these seven segments become your seven Wind-gods, the rulers of seven ethereal-places, under your 
ruler-ship. [1-47-3]
Oh, son Indra, let these seven sons of mine become the seven presiding deities of 
Cosmic Air Divisions and let them move in heaven with heavenly forms. [1-47-4]
One from the seven may permeate Brahma's abode, likewise another may permeate the 
heaven of Indra, and even the third one, let him become a greatly celebrated and reputed as Divine Wind, 
and he may circulate in entire universe. [1-47-5]
'Oh, chief of gods, Indra, let four of my sons permeate four directions according to 
time and at your command, let safety betide you, and let them be renowned verily by the name given by 
you as 'Marut,' because you have coaxed the crying fragments of foetus saying, 'maa ruda, maa ruda, 
'do not cry, do not cry...' Thus Diti said to Indra. [1-47-6, 7a]
On hearing her words, the Thousand-eyed destroyer of enemy's citadels and a demon named 
Bala, namely Indra, spoke this word to Diti, humbly adjoining his palms. [1-47-7b, 8a]
" 'All this will happen as you have said, undoubtedly, and your offspring, the Maaruta-s, 
would be pervading in the forms of gods, you be safe.' Thus Indra assured Diti. Those two, the stepmother 
Diti and the stepson Indra, on arriving at a decision in that ascetic forest, departed to heaven fulfilling 
their purposes. Thus we heard the legend." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-47-8b, 9, 10a]
Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, this province is that one which was once presided over by Indra, 
and where he rendered services to that accomplished one in her asceticism, namely lady Diti. [1-47-10b, 
11a]
To king Ikshvaku of Vishaala, oh, tigerly-man Rama, a highly righteous son was born 
through queen Alambusa, and he was renowned as Vishaala. There is a city in this place constructed by 
him and known by his own name, Vishaala. [1-47-11b, 12]
"Oh, Rama, Vishaala's son is the great-mighty Hemachandra, and Hemachandra's son is highly 
renowned as Suchandra.. [1-47-13]
"The son of Suchandra became famous as Dhuumraashva, and oh, Rama, Dhuumraashva derived 
his son named Srinjaya. [1-47-14]
The fortunate and valorous son of Srinjaya is Sahadeva, and the son of Sahadeva is the 
most righteous Kushaashva. [1-47-15]
The highly resplendent and dauntless Somadatta is the son of Kushaashva and Somadatta's 
son is highly reputed as Kakutstha. [1-47-16]
Presently that Kakutstha's son named Sumati, who is a great-resplendent one, an unconquerable 
one, and a highly celebrated one is dwelling in this city. [1-47-17]
By the grace of Ikshvaku, the successive kings of Vishaala have longevity, intrepidity, 
well-off in generosity, and they were great-souled ones. [1-47-18]
"Today we may gladly go to sleep here for a night, and oh, best one among men, and it 
will be apt of you to see Janaka, the King of Mithila tomorrow morning." Thus Sage Vishvamitra spoke 
to Rama and Lakshmana. [1-47-19]
The best one among best men, a widely reputed and the highly resplendent king of Vishaala, 
namely Sumati, having heard that Vishvamitra has arrived at the precincts of the city, came to him for 
a warm welcome. [1-47-20]
King Sumati arrived along with his mentors and family members, offered an excellent veneration 
to Vishvamitra, and then spoke to the sage with adjoined palms enquiring about his well being. [1-47-21]
"To which province you have visited that happens to be mine, thereby I could get an audience 
of yours without stirring myself from my country, hence none will be more fortunate than me." So said 
king Sumati to Vishvamitra. [1-47-22]

"Oh, Rambha, now you have to undertake this very great task of gods in enchanting Vishvamitra with 
a craving caused by lust, for lusting after you.' Thus Indra ordered Rambha..." Thus Sage Shataananda 
continued the legend of Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-64-1]

Oh, Rama, when that celestial wench is spoken thus by the Thousand-eyed Indra, she diffidently said 
to that chief of gods while adjoining her palms suppliantly. [1-64-2]

'Oh, chief of gods, Indra, that great saint Vishvamitra is a dangerous one and undoubtedly he releases 
his deadly anger on me. Oh, god, thereby I am fearful of him. Hence, oh, god, it will be apt of you 
to accord forbearance.' So said Rambha to Indra. [1-64-3, 4a]

Oh, Rama, the Thousand-eyed Indra replied Rambha when she spoke to him in that way while shuddering 
in fear and making palm fold in supplication. [1-64-4b, 5a]

You need not be fearful, Rambha, carry out my command, safe betides you, I on becoming a heart-stealing 
black-songbird will be at your side along with Love-god in the pleasing trees of springtime. [1-64-5b, 
6]

'Indeed on your assuming a highly sparkling semblance, and multi-multiplexing your savoir faire, with 
bon viveurs and bon vivants, you disengage that ascetical sage Kaushika from his ascesis.' So said Indra 
to Rambha. [1-64-7]

On hearing the sentence of Indra she adopted an unexcelled physique, and on becoming a pulchritudinous 
damsel she started to entice Vishvamitra with giggly grins. [1-64-8]

Vishvamitra has heard melodious trilling tune of songbird, and while his heart is highly gladdening 
about the ambience, he incidentally saw and stared at Rambha. [1-64-9]

By the exceptional trilling tune of that songbird and by the unexceptional tableau of Rambha the sage 
is on his qui vive. [1-64-10]

On knowing that as an escapade of the Thousand-eyed Indra, Vishvamitra is enwrapped in wrath and he 
cursed Rambha. [1-64-11]

Whereof you tried to entice me who am wishing to win over the wanton and wroth, you unlucky female 
Rambha, thereof you will become a rocklike statued wastrel. [1-64-12]

'A highly resplendent Brahman who is ascetically powerful redeems you, oh, Rambha, who are now blemished 
by my anger.' Vishvamitra cursed Rambha in this way. [1-64-13]

Thus the great-resplendent Vishvamitra became compunctious when that great-saint could not contain 
his anger in uttering an angry curse. [1-64-14]

Then Rambha has become a rocklike statue by that great curse of Vishvamitra, and having heard the words 
of that great-saint Love-god and Indra also took flight. [1-64-15]

Owing to his angering that great-resplendent Vishvamitra is now divested of his ascetical merit, and 
he has no peace of mind owing to ungovernable senses. [1-64-16]

His conscience became sentimental owing to the divesture of his ascetical merit, and he soliloquised, 
'I shall not succumb to wrath in anyway, nor I put my presentiment into words.' [1-64-17]

Otherwise, I do not even respire for a hundred years for the respiratory gestures will also exhibit 
moods, and I indeed emaciate myself until I become a real conqueror of my own senses. [1-64-18]

'Till such time as I acquire Brahman-hood with the merit of my own ascesis I will be breathless and 
foodless, even if it is going to take endless years, and while I am in ascesis my bodily organs indeed 
will not undergo any deterioration.' So said Vishvamitra to himself. [1-64-19]

"Thus that eminent sage abided by the commitment to the vow for a thousand years, oh, Rama, the legatee 
of Ragu, which is a nonpareil vow in the world." Thus Shataananda continued. [1-64-20]

Those envoys who are clearly ordered by Janaka entered the city of Ayodhya on sojourning 
for three nights en route, and whose horses are overtired for they are galloped 
so fast to loose no time. [1-68-1]

On going to the palace those envoys are given an audience with the consent of Dasharatha, 
and when they are conducted into the palace-chambers they have seen the elderly 
king Dasharatha gleaming like a god. [1-68-2]

Completely gone is the angst of all the legates on seeing godly Dasharatha, and 
all of them adjoing palms in reverence said this compliant and mellowly worded sentence 
to the king. [1-68-3]

Oh, exalted emperor Dasharatha! Janaka, the lineal king of Janaka-s and the present 
sovereign of Mithila is asking time and time again with mellowly words instilled 
with friendliness, after the wellbeing and after the unmitigated prosperity of your 
highness, along with that of your highness' priests and teachers, also that of your 
highness' subjects, who always precede your highness in convoys in any event, as 
your highness are the one who ingratiates himself with the Ritual-fires, ever and 
anon... [1-68-4, 5]

His highness Janaka of Videha, and the sovereign of Mithila, having asked after 
your highness' wellbeing is sensibly saying this word to your highness, with the 
indorse of Kaushika... [1-68-6]

Well-known is the solemn promise of mine that my daughter Seetha is a bounty 
for bravery... also well-know is that the kings who came to lift the bow turned 
out as gutless kings, and then they turned out as rancorous kings at me, and it 
is also well-known that I turned them back with my guts... [1-68-7]

Oh, Emperor Dasharatha, your young and valorous son who serendipitously arrived 
at Mithila along with his younger brother Lakshmana, keeping Vishvamitra at his 
fore, finally carries off this girl, the well-known daughter of mine... [1-68-8]

Also, oh, highly dextrous king Dasharatha, noble souled Rama wrecked that divine 
bow, which is a gem of a bow among bows, at its central point before a grand assembly 
of people... [1-68-9]

Seetha is the bounty for bravery and I shall have to afford her to the noble-souled 
Rama, as such it will be apt of you to give your consent as I wish to keep up my 
solemn promise... [1-68-10]

Keeping your royal priest Vashishta and other teachers ahead of you, oh, great 
emperor, I wish you to come apace, let safe betide you, for it will be apt of you 
to take a look at your ennobled son Rama, and Lakshmana, too... [1-68-11]

'It will be apt of you to make my solemn promise maintainable, and that way you 
will derive delight on seeing both of your sons...' [1-68-12]

"Thus the sovereign of Videha kingdom said these endearing words, abiding by the 
counsel of Sage Shataananda, and Sage Vishvamitra is also consentient to the proposal..." 
Thus the envoys conveyed the proposal and paused. [1-68-13]

King Dasharatha is highly gladdened on hearing that message from the delegates, 
and said this way to Vashishta, Vaamadeva, and to his other ministers, as well. 
[1-68-14]

This one Rama, the enhancer of Kausalya's rejoice, is stopping over at Videha kingdom 
along with his brother Lakshmana, and Vishvamitra is taking care of both these boys... 
[1-68-15]

On observing the valour of Kakutstha Rama, noble souled Janaka wishes to gift his 
daughter as bride to Raghava Rama... [1-68-16]

"If you all favour the tidings from the noble-souled Janaka as to what has happened 
in Mithila, we quickly proceed to that city, let not the time lapse..." Thus Dasharatha 
informed his counsel. [1-68-17]

The ministers along with all of the great sages said in consonance, "Most Welcome..." 
and then that highly pleased king Dasharatha said to the ministers, "we travel tomorrow..." 
[1-68-18]

The ministers of king Janaka who are gifted with all talents are given grateful 
hospitality by Dasharatha, and they all dwelt that night in Ayodhya, overjoyed at 
the successful completion of their august legatine, called <font color="#B3003A">

"On hearing the sentence of Trishanku, oh, Rama, the hundred sons of sage Vashishta infuriately said 
this to that king." Thus, sage Shataananda continued his narration to Rama and others. [1-58-1]

'You slow-witted king, your veracious mentor has denounced you. But transgressing him how do you approach 
another branch of the same tree of wisdom, when that very tree rejected you?' So the sons of Vashishta 
have started to denounce Trishanku. [1-58-2]

'The Royal Priest is the ultimate course for all of Ikshvaku-s, isn't it. It is impossible to transgress 
the word of advise of such a veracious Priest. [1-58-3]

Vashishta is the most reverential sage and such a sage has already said it is impossible to conduct 
such a Vedic-ritual. Then, in which way we are capable to conduct such a Vedic-ritual? [1-58-4]

'Oh king of subjects, better get back to your own city again for you are childish. That godlike Vashishta 
alone is capable to orchestrate any ritual by any king in all the three worlds. Oh, king, how then we 
are capable to cause a disrepute to his reputation.' Thus, the sons of Vashishta refuted Trishanku. 
[1-58-5, 6a]

"On hearing that sentence of theirs which is highly faltering with words of fury that king further spoke 
this sentence to all of them." So Shataananda continued. [1-58-6b, 7a]

'I am indeed rejected by the godlike Vashishta, likewise even by you, the sons of the same mentor, 
as such oh, ascetically wealthy scholars, in this state obloquy I will resort to another recourse, let 
safety betide you.' So Trishanku bade farewell to the sons of Vashishta, but... [1-58-7b, 8a]

But the sons of the sage Vashishta, on hearing that sentence of the king, that is inclusive of and 
leading to a calamitous situation, have become very highly infuriated and cursed saying, 'you shall 
get into a state of basely profaner.' That is the curse issued by the sons of Vashishta to Trishanku. 
[1-58-8b, 9a]

On saying thus those great-souled sons of Vashishta withdrew to one's own hermitage and when that night 
elapsed into day then the king lapsed into a state of basely profaner. [1-58-9b, 10a]

He is now wearing blackish cloths which on yestereve were ochry silks, he is now a blackamoor who on 
yestereve was a gilt-royalty, his head-hair is shaggy which earlier was silkily soft, and his royal 
garlands which were richly fragrant are now funeral wreaths, and he is besmeared with crematory ashes 
which were regal emollients, and his royal jewellery is now rendered into iron adornments. [1-58-10b, 
11a]

On seeing him in the mien of a profaner, oh, Rama, all of his ministers and the subjects and his own 
retinue have deserted him and took to flight in masses. [1-58-11b, 12a]

Though that resolutely self-assured king seethed for one night and day for this mishap, then went to 
the ascetically prosperous Vishvamitra. [1-58-12b, 13a]

But on seeing at that mien of the king which is rendered to that of a precluded profaner from kingship 
and for officiating rituals etc., oh, Rama, sage Vishvamitra because sympathetic. [1-58-13b, 14a]

The great-resplendent sage and highly generous Vishvamitra firstly said to that king who is in a terrible 
aspect 'let safety betide you,' and then spoke on this sentence to him. [1-58-14b, 15a]

'What is the purpose of your visit, oh, great-mighty prince Trishanku, oh, brave lord of Ayodhya, 
you are accurst to the state of profaner.' [1-58-15b, 16a]

Then that king who is accurst to a state of profaner on listening that sentence, as a diligent sentence 
maker spoke this sentence with his palms adjoined to the sententious sage Vishvamitra. [1-58-16b, 17a]

I am spurned off by my mentor Vashishta and also like that by his sons. My aspiration remained unachievable, 
besides, this discrepancy has bechanced upon me. [1-58-17b, 18a]

'Oh, gentle Vishvamitra, my aspiration is nothing but to go to heaven with my body. I have performed 
hundred rituals but I have not achieved the fruit.' Thus Trishanku started tell his sad tale.

And now if you doubt me to be a liar, I am no liar either. I spoke no lie heretofore, and even if 
I were to land into any predicament I do not speak lies anytime hereinafter. Oh, gentle sage, this I 
pledge you upon my virtue of Kshatriya-hood. [1-58-19, 20a]

I have propitiated gods with many kinds of Vedic-rituals. I have reigned over people conscientiously. 
And with my conduct and comport the high-souled savants are also pleased. [1-58-20b, 21a]

While I am a pursuant in probity I expect to avail myself of the fruition of this kind of Vedic-ritual. 
Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, but my mentors are not deriving complete contentment by my pursuit. Hence, 
they shove me off. [1-58-21b, 22a]

I deem destiny is the only ultimate, and manly efforts are meaningless, for destiny surmounts everything. 
Destiny is the ultimate course, isn't it? [1-58-22b, 23a]

A highly anguished endeavourer, marred by destiny, a sincere requester, such as I am, it will be 
apt of you to accord, you be safe, your favour upon me. [1-58-23b, c]

" 'In no alternate course I wish to course through and no alternative shelter is there for me. Hence, 
it will be apt of you, a god in man's mien, to countervail my destiny.' Thus Trishanku prayed for the 
grace of Vishvamitra..." So said Sage Shataananda to Rama and others continuing the legend of Vishvamitra.

"When thousand years are completed in ascesis and when that great saint Vishvamitra 
took a bath of solemnity, all the gods have come forward wishing to accord the fruit 
of that ascesis to Vishvamitra." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. 
[1-63-1]

The very highly resplendent Brahma spoke to him with highly palatable words, 'you 
have now become a kingly sage by virtue of auspicious deeds you have personally 
undertaken, let safeness betide you.' [1-63-2]

On speaking to Vishvamitra in that way Brahma returned to heaven, and that highly 
vigorous Vishvamitra again performed a great ascesis. [1-63-3]

Then at a long lost time Menaka, the prominent apsara, celestial wench, has arrived 
and started to swim for sport in that holy lake. [1-63-4]

That great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has seen Menaka who is incomparable in 
her mien and comparable to an electric-flash in a black-cloud, while she is swimming 
in the holy lake. [1-63-5]

On seeing her the sage having gone under the sway the Love-god said this to her, 
'oh, apsara, you are welcome, I invite you to bide in my hermitage. Oblige me who 
am bewitched by Love-god for you. You be safe.' [1-63-6, 7a]

When he said thus to her, oh, Raghava, then she made a stopover there and ten years 
rolled by comfortably, and oh, gentle Rama, because of her staying Vishvamitra is 
indeed faced with a great hindrance in his ascesis. [1-63-7b, 8, 9a]

Then after the lapse of that ten year period Vishvamitra became doleful with distress 
and he is enwrapped in humiliation, as it were, and, oh, Rama, Raghu's legatee, 
then a resentful thought occurred to him. [1-63-9b, 10]

All this is the mischief of gods to defraud me of the great merit of my ascesis. 
Ten years have rolled by as if they are just a day and a night. Furthermore, I who 
am under the influence of lust and lure had to encounter this hindrance in my ascesis. 
[1-63-11, 12a]

Oh, Rama, that best saint suspired heavily when he became emotional with reparation. 
But on seeing the scared celestial wench Menaka, who is shivering and waiting with 
suppliantly adjoined palms, he sent her away with pleasant words, and he that Vishvamitra 
indeed went to the northern Himalayan mountain. [1-63-12b, 13, 14a]

He that highly celebrated sage who made a resolve to attain a sang-froid temperament 
and to vanquish lust, performed an unsurpassable ascesis on reaching the riverbank 
of River Kaushiki. [1-63-14b, 15a]

Oh, Rama, while he reverently performed an unspeakable ascesis for a thousand years 
on the northern mountain, namely Himalayas, then fear occurred to gods. [1-63-15b, 
16a]

' All gods coming together with assemblages of sages have approached Brahma and conveyed 
that, 'this Vishvamitra, the son of Kushika, may duly be given the epithet of 'Maharshi, 
Exalted Sage.' [1-63-16b, 17a]

On listening the advice of gods, Brahma, the Grandparent of all the worlds, spoke 
these pleasant words to the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra. [1-63-17b, 18a]

'Oh, exalted sage, I welcome you my dear, as I am gladdened by your stern ascesis, 
oh, Kaushika, I bestow upon you the sublimity and supremacy among sages.' [1-63-18b, 
19a]

And on hearing the words of Brahma he that ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra became 
obeisant and replied the Grandparent adjoining his palms suppliantly. [1-63-19b, 
20a]

'If your Godhead had said that I am a Brahma-sage, a sageship acquired personally 
by my pious deeds, rather than an exalted sage, then I would have become one who 
is really self-conquered.' Thus Vishvamitra said to Brahma. [1-63-20, 21a]

Brahma then said to him, 'your senses remain unconquered as such, oh, tigerly sage, 
make an effort for it.' Saying so Brahma went heavenward. [1-63-21b, 22a]

While the gods who came here along with Brahma have returned, that great sage Vishvamitra 
undertook another round of ascesis by standing in levitation, upraising his arms, 
and subsisting on air alone. [1-63-22b, 23a]

In summer he became the Five-Fire Ascetic, in rainy season open sky is his rooftop, 
and in winter water is his reclining bed even by day or by night, and thus that 
ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra indeed undertook a severe ascesis in this way, for 
another thousand years. [1-63-23b, 24]

While that great saint is undertaking fervent ascesis it has become a very high 
burning problem to gods and even to Indra. [1-63-25]

"Then Indra along with all the assemblages of the Air-gods spoke to Rambha, the 
celestial wench, words that are advantageous to himself, but disadvantageous to 
the son of sage Kushi, namely Vishvamitra." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his 
narration. [1-63-26]

			"Once there was a highly righteous kingly sage who is the brainchild 
			of Brahma, whose ascesis is of higher order, who has never flouted the 
			rules of rituals or his vows, and who revered the knowers of virtue 
			by name Kusha." Thus Sage Vishvamitra commenced narration. [1-32-1]

			"That great-souled Kusha begot four selfsame and mighty sons, namely 
			Kushamba, Kushanaabha, Adhuurtarajasa also called as Asuurtarajasa,  
			and Vasu through the princess of Vidarbha, which princess is of noble 
			birth and an eligible wife of Kusha. [1-32-2, 3a]

			"With an aspiration that his sons shall uphold the principles of Kshatriya-s, 
			Kusha spoke to them who are brilliant, highly enthusiastic, virtue abiding, 
			and the advocators of truth saying, 'establish your rulership, sons, 
			and achieve righteousness abundantly.' [1-32-3b, 4]

			"On hearing the words of Kusha those four sons that are the formidable 
			ones in the world and the best men among people initiated to build four 
			cities. [1-32-5]

			"Great-resplendent Kushamba built the city named Kaushambii for his 
			part, and for his part the virtue-souled Kushanaabha built a city named 
			Mahodaya. [1-32-6]

			"Oh, Rama, noble-minded Adhuurtarajasa built a city named Dharmaaranya, 
			and king Vasu built a city in the name of Girivraja. [1-32-7]

			"This land on which we are presently staying is known as the land of 
			virtue-souled Vasu, all around which these five best mountains are standing 
			high. [1-32-8]

			"This charming river that enters and exits Magadha province is well 
			known as the worthy River Maagadhi, and flowing amid the five of these 
			elevated mountains it shines forth like a garland enwreathing them. 
			[1-32-9]

							"Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great mighty princes
							 are rendered incapable to string its bowstring.

			"This Maagadhi is that river which pertains to the developmental works 
			of the great-souled king Vasu and oh, Rama, flowing towards east to 
			its confluence in Ganga, this river garlands best farmlands and their 
			crops on its way. [1-32-10]

			"The virtue-souled kingly saint Kushanaabha gave birth to a hundred 
			daughters with unexcelled beauty through a celestial female called Ghritaachi. 
			[1-32-11]

			"Those girls when attained youthfulness they are lovely and on an occasion 
			they have gone to gardens and moved there about like one lightning with 
			a hundred streaks during rainy season, and while those girls that are 
			decorated with select ornaments are singing, dancing and playing musical 
			instruments, they got into a fantastic felicity. [1-32-12, 13]

			"On their coming to parklands those girls whose all limbs are pretty 
			and whose looks are unparalleled on earth, they looked like stars amid 
			clouds within the cloudy thickets of garden bushes. [1-32-14]

			"On seeing them who are flourishing with all their aspects together 
			with comeliness and ripeness, the all pervading Air-god, Vayu, spoke 
			this word to them. [1-32-15]

			" 'I have a desire for you all, hence leaving off the notions pertaining 
			to human beings you all become my wives, thereby you too will acquire 
			longevity like divinities. [1-32-16]

			" 'Teenage is always transitory, expressly in humans, but on marrying 
			me you will achieve undiminished youthfulness and forever you can be 
			youthful like immortal females.' Thus Air-god said to those girls. [1-32-17]

			"On hearing that proposal of Vayu, the Air-god whose strives are unimpeded, 
			then those hundred girls spoke this sentence laughing off his proposal. 
			[1-32-18]

			" 'we are aware that you inspirit all the living beings from inside, 
			oh, the ablest divinity, we are also aware of your uniqueness. But, 
			what for you are dishonouring all of us. [1-32-19]

			" 'We are the daughters of Kushanaabha, oh, best divinity, and we are 
			all capable of displacing you from your realm, but oh, god, we are restraining 
			ourselves in doing so only to conserve our ascetic values. [1-32-20]

			" 'That time shall never come, oh, god with sordid thinking, when we, 
			at our liberty, may look up for our grooms overlooking our veracious 
			father.' [1-32-21]

			" 'Our father is indeed our lord and for us he is the ultimate god too. 
			To whomever we are offered by our father in marriage he alone becomes 
			our husband.' So said hundred girls to Air-god. [1-32-22]

			On hearing their sentence of rejection, Vayu, the Air-god whose impact 
			is powerful, very angrily entered into all of the limbs of those girls 
			only to disfigure them. [1-32-23]

			"Those girls whom Air-god disfigured in that way have entered palace-chambers 
			of the king, but they have entered diffidently, embarrassedly, and tearfully. 
			[1-32-24]

			"That king on seeing his dear and attractive daughters as disfigured 
			and despondent girls he is highly perturbed and said this. [1-32-25]

			" 'Oh, daughters, what all is this? Who disregarded probity? Who disfigured 
			you all? Let it be said! Why you gesticulate saying nothing.' asking 
			thus that king sighed and quietened down waiting for a reply." Thus 
			Sage Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-32-26]

			Then, on staying that night there in Tataka forest, on the next day 
			morning the greatly renowned sage Vishvamitra, smilingly and wording 
			sweetly spoke to Rama. [1-27-1]

			"I am highly pleased with you, oh, illustrious prince Rama, let safety 
			be with you, I will now give you all of the divine missiles in utmost 
			fondness of mine. [1-27-2]

			"I am going to accord all of those divine missiles by which scores of 
			gods, demons, or even from gandharva-s, uragaa-s and the like, or even 
			earthlings are dominated, humbled down and conquered in war. Let safety 
			be with you. [1-27-3, 4a]

			"Raghava, I am going to give the highly divine Danda disc [Punisher 
			disc]; next, oh, best one among men, Dharma disc [Virtue-disc,] and 
			like that kaala disc [Time-disc]; then oh, brave one, Vishnu disc; similarly 
			oh, dextrous Rama, Indra disc and Thunderbolt missile; the best trident 
			pertaining to Shiva; the missile called Brahma-shira [Brahma-crest]; 
			the missile called the Aishiika missile [Grass-Blade missile,] and that 
			way oh, Raghava, I am going to give the unexcelled and highly formidable 
			missile called Brahma missile. [1-27-4b, 5, 6, 7a]

			"Oh manly tiger prince Rama, I am going to accord two maces that are 
			brilliant by their radiance called, the Modaki, [the Beater,] and Shikhari, 
			[the Tower of Protection.] [1-27-7b, 8a]

			"Oh, Rama, like that I will be giving three nooses called Dharma paasha 
			and kaala-paasha and Varuna paasha, [Virtue noose and Time noose, Rain 
			god's noose] as well as an unequalled missile called Varuna astra, Rain-god's 
			missile. [1-27-8b, 9a]

			"Oh, Raghu's scion, I will also give two projectile bolts, one called 
			shushka [The Drier] and the other aardra [The Drencher] and even 
			the missiles of Pinaaka and that of Narayana, [the missiles of god Shiva 
			and Narayana] I will give. [1-27-9b, 10a]

			"Oh, impeccable Rama, thus a well-known missile shikhari [The Tower] 
			and another the fond of Fire-god known as prathama [The Blower] and 
			a missile of Air-god too, I will be giving. [1-27-10b, 11a]

			"Oh, Raghava of Kakutstha-s, I will give you two missiles named Haya-shira 
			[The Horse-head] and Krouncha [The Wrester] and two Impellers, one 
			presided over by the power of Vishnu, and the other by the power of 
			Rudra. [1-27-11b, 12a]

			"I will be giving all those weapons that are wielded by demons, namely 
			the deadly Pounder named Kankaalam, and Rods named as Kapaalam and Kankanam, 
			for the elimination of those very demons. [1-27-12b, 13a]

			"Oh, mighty armed son of the best king, I am giving a great missile 
			named Vaidyadhara by its name, and a gem of sword named Nandana. [1-27-13b, 
			14a]

			"Thus, the missile which is very much liked by Gandharva-s, namely Mohana, 
			[The Stupefier,] the missile called Prasvapana [The Inducer of Sleep,] 
			and the gentle Prashamana [The Pacifier of enemy's anger.] [1-27-14b, 
			15a]

			"Oh, highly fortunate Rama, take these missiles namely, varshaNa, [the 
			Rainer,] shoshana [the Drainer,] santaapana [the Humidifier,] vilaapana 
			[the Weep-inducer,] and oh, prince, an unassailable intoxicator and 
			a dear missile of Manmatha, namely Mohana [The Intoxicator,] and another 
			the fond missile of gandharva-s namely maanava by its name, [The Humane 
			missile,] and oh, tigerly man, a missile dear one to pishaaca-s, monsters, 
			namely paishaca [The Monster missile.] [1-27-15, 16, 17]

			"Oh, manly-tiger Rama, greatly powered taamasa and saumana missiles, 
			the indomitable missiles like samvarta, mausala, satya, and then the 
			maaya-maya missile; like that oh, mighty armed Rama, a solar missile 
			the sequestrator of others' brilliance namely teja-prabha; next, the 
			missile of Moon-god named shishira [The Cooler]; and a very deadly missile 
			of tvaSTa namely sudaamana; and even the dangerous missile of bhaga 
			namely shita-iSu, these and the maanava missile of Manu, the earliest 
			ruler of mankind, I will be giving. [1-27-17b, 18, 19, 20]

			"These missiles are, oh, dextrous prince, disguise-wizards, greatly 
			powered, and highly providential ones, oh, Rama, you may take them forthwith." 
			So said sage Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-27-21]

			That pre-eminent sage Vishvamitra on performing his personal holy depuration 
			then gave the assortment of extraordinary hymns to Rama facing eastward. 
			[1-27-22]

			The comprehension of which invoking hymns of the missiles is impossible 
			even to gods with their sections and subsections of procedures, that 
			Brahman dedicated such hymns to Raghava. [1-27-24]

			While that intelligent saint Vishvamitra chanted the hymns, all of those 
			highly venerable missiles came nigh and stood accessible to Raghava 
			in their astral form. [1-27-24]

			All of those highly obliging missiles in astral bodies, gladdening to 
			come under the aegis of Rama, then spoke to him making palms-fold, "here 
			are your thralls, Sire, we are here to accomplish whatever you bid us 
			to do, let safety be with you." So said the deities presiding over the 
			missiles to Rama. [1-27-25]

			On receiving them with a pleased heart, then Rama patted them with his 
			palm, and that Rama of Kakutstha-s also spoke this way to those mightily 
			forceful missiles in ethereal bodies saying, "you may manifest yourselves 
			in my cognisance whenever I need you," and he motivated them to take 
			leave and to come back at his beck and call. [1-27-26b, 27]

			That highly resplendent Rama revered sage Vishvamitra with a thankful 
			heart and readied himself for further journey. [1-27-26]

			On listening the grand and detailed sentences of that King the lion Dasharatha, 
			the great resplendent Sage Vishvamitra is thrilled with happiness and spoke this 
			way. [1-19-1]

			"Oh, tigerly king, to you befitting are these words and to none else, as you are 
			born in a great dynasty and tutored by Vashishta. [1-19-2]

			"What concerns I have in my heart I am going to say, and you take decision thereof, 
			oh, tigerly-king, and become truthful to your promises. [1-19-3]

			"These days I am abiding by a sacrificial vow to attain a spiritual goal but, 
			oh, best one among men, two guise changing demons as causing obstacles to that 
			ritual. [1-19-4]

			"At the near end of almost completed ritual of mine two valiant and well-trained 
			demons, namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are drenching the Altar of Fire with streams 
			of meat and blood. [1-19-5, 6a]

			"When the ritual vow is thus ravaged I, as the one who exerted myself for the 
			ritual, had to depart from that place, unenthusiastically. [1-19-6n, 7a]

			"And to me there is no will to let loose my anger, oh, king, as no curse shall 
			be issued under vows, and like that the activity during rituals shall be inoffensive, 
			isn't it. [1-19-7b, 8a]

			"As such, oh, tigerly king, it will be apt of you spare the services of that brave 
			one whose valour itself is his truthfulness, that youngling whose hair locks are 
			all the more jet black like crow wings on either side of his head, spare that 
			eldest son of yours, namely Rama. [1-19-8b, 9a]

			"Indeed, he is capable to eradicate those demons that are thwarting the ritual 
			by his own divine resplendence, and protected by me as well. [1-19-9b, 10a]

			"I will also accord many kinds of benefits to him by which he acquires renown 
			in all the three worlds, no doubt about it. [1-19-10b, 11a]

			"Those two demons will be rendered incapable to stand fast on affronting Rama 
			in anywise, and none other than Raghava has the fortitude to eliminate those two. 
			[1-19-11b, 12a]

			"Those two sinners that are berserk by their vigour have gone into the subjection 
			of death's noose, oh tigerly king, cannot counterbalance the great-souled Rama. 
			[1-19-12b, 13a]

			"It will be unapt of you to show your paternal fondness, oh, king, upon my oath, 
			be assured that those two demons are eradicated. [1-19-13b, 14a]

			"I am sensible of that sublime-soul Rama, whose valour is his truthfulness, and 
			even this great resplendent Vashishta and these saints that are here are aware. 
			[1-19-14b, 15a]

			"If you wish to gain in value of probity, a long-lasting and paramount renown 
			on earth it will be apt of you to handover Rama to me. [1-19-15b, 16a]

			"Oh, Dasharatha, you may send Rama if only your ministers and all the other elite 
			headed by Vashishta are going to give assent. [1-19-16b, 17a]

			"It will be apt of you to send your choicest son, the lotus-eyed Rama, just for 
			ten days of the ritual without temporising. [1-19-17b, 18a]

			"I wish you to take decision as to how my ritual's time is not lapsed, and 
			let safety betide you, let not your heart be rendered to grieve." Thus Vishvamitra 
			said to Dasharatha. [1-19-18b, 19a]

			On saying those words that comprise fairness and meaningfulness that virtue-souled 
			great saint with great resplendence paused. [1-19-19b, 20a]

			On hearing the propitious words of sage Vishvamitra that best king Dasharatha 
			shuddered and swooned as he is muffled up with profound adversity, and after that 
			on regaining consciousness he sunk down in fear. [1-19-20b, 21]

			This way on hearing that word of the saint Vishvamitra which is explicitly slitting 
			his mind and heart that illustrious and noble-souled king Dasharatha then became 
			highly annoyed at heart, and flustered extremely in his throne. [1-19-22]

			"On observing that his sons have gone long time back in search of ritual-horse, 
			oh, Rama, king Sagara spoke this to his grandson, Amshuman, who is radiant 
			with his own self-resplendence." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration 
			about Sagara. [1-41-1]

			'You are brave one and completed your education in warfare, such as 
			you are, you are a coequal to your paternal-uncles in magnificence, 
			thus you search the course of your paternal uncles, also him by whom 
			the horse is stolen.' Thus King Sagara started speaking to his grandson 
			Amshuman. [1-41-2]

			The living beings in netherworlds of earth are intrepid and they 
			are extraordinary also, hence you take your bow along with your sword 
			to retaliate them in the event of their attacking you. [1-41-3]

			'On saluting them that are worthy for salutations, and on eliminating 
			them that are the causer of obstructions, you shall achieve your purpose 
			of tracking the ritual-horse, and thus you comeback safely and let my 
			Vedic-ritual be crossed over to the other shore of mortality by you.' 
			Thus king Sagara told his grandson Amshuman. [1-41-4]

			When the great-souled king Sagara has thoroughly said in this way, 
			that adroitly agile Amshuman proceeded wielding a bow and a sword. [1-41-5]

			Motivated by the King Sagara, oh, Rama, the best one among men, Amshuman 
			progressed on the walkway that was hollowed out by his great-souled 
			paternal-uncles inside the earth. [1-41-6]

			And he that resplendent Amshuman beheld one of the four directional 
			elephant of the earth which is being venerated by gods, monsters, demons, 
			imps, vultures and serpents. [1-41-7]

			On circumambulating that elephant in supplication, and even on enquiring 
			after its well-being, he that Amshuman has enquired in detail with it 
			for his paternal-uncles and even about the robber of the ritual-horse. 
			[1-41-8]

			On hearing that enquiry of Amshuman that directional elephant with 
			great perception replied on its part saying, 'oh Amshuman, son of Asamanja, 
			on achieving your mission you will return expeditiously along with the 
			horse'. [1-41-9]

			On hearing that word of that directional elephant he departed from 
			there, and on sequentially reaching other directional elephants that 
			are abiding in other directions of earth, he commenced to ask the same 
			enquiry which he made with the first, according to the positioning of 
			elephants in directions, and according to the established procedures 
			of their venerability. [1-41-10]

			All the elephants that safeguard the directions of earth which have 
			the faculties of articulation and eloquence have adored Amshuman and 
			motivated him by saying, 'you will be going from here taking the horse.' 
			[1-41-11]

			On hearing that common blessing of all the directional-elephants, he 
			that nimble-footed Amshuman has gone to the place where his paternal-uncles, 
			sons of Sagara, were rendered as mounds of ashes. [1-41-12]

			But he on whom the control of anguish has chanced for not physically 
			seeing his paternal-uncles, that son of Asamanja then wept, as he is 
			highly agonised and extremely anguished at their destruction. [1-41-13]

			That tigerly-man Amshuman who is overwhelmed by agony and anguish, 
			also beheld there the horse of Vedic-ritual that is grazing nearby. 
			[1-41-14]

			When he that great resplendent Amshuman wanted to offer obsequial waters 
			to the departed sons of Sagara and searched for water he has not found 
			any fount of water. [1-41-15]

			Spanning his expert glances, oh, Rama, he then saw the rapid-winged 
			king of birds, namely Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu, who is the 
			maternal uncle of his father and other paternal-uncles, and whose flight 
			will be similar to that of the Wind-god. [1-41-16]

			That great-mighty son of Lady Vinata, namely Garuda, also spoke this 
			word to Amshuman, 'do not bemoan, oh, tigerly-man, this eradication 
			of your paternal-uncles is worthwhile to the worlds'. [1-41-17]

			In fact, Kapila, the Imponderable Sage, has burnt down those great-mighty 
			paternal-uncles of yours, oh, observant Amshuman, as such it will not 
			be apt of you to offer the mundane obsequial water-oblations to them, 
			indeed. [1-41-18]

			'Oh, best one among men, River Ganga is the elder daughter of 
			Himavanta, and oh, dextrous one, you have to offer water-oblation to 
			the departed paternal-uncles of yours in her waters, namely the holy 
			waters of River Ganga'. [1-41-19]

			World purifier River Ganga will drift them who are rendered as mounds 
			of ashes to heaven, and when she who is much adored by all worlds drenches 
			this ash, that River Ganga herself will lead the sixty-thousand sons 
			of Sagara to heaven. [1-41-20]

			'Oh, great fortunate one, oh, best one among men, you may proceed 
			from here with the horse, oh, brave one, it will be apt of you to carry 
			out the Vedic-ritual of your grandfather.' Thus Garuda said to Amshuman. 
			[1-41-21]

			On hearing the words of that great-winged eagle, Garuda, he that highly 
			brave and well-renowned Amshuman swiftly took the horse, and returned 
			to the ritual place of his grandfather, king Sagara. [1-41-22]

			Then on reaching the King Sagara, who is under the vow of the ritual, 
			oh, Rama, Amshuman described what all has happened and even the words 
			of Garuda. [1-41-23]

			On hearing those unendurable words from Amshuman, the king Sagara firstly 
			completed the Vedic-ritual scripturally and procedurally. [1-41-24]

			On completing the Vedic-ritual King Sagara arrived at his capital, 
			but that king could not arrive at a decision about the arrival of Ganga 
			to the earth. [1-41-25]

			"That great king Sagara could not get at any resolve in getting Ganga 
			to earth even after a long time, and on ruling kingdom for thirty-thousand 
			years he went to heaven." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about 
			the ancestors of Rama. [1-41-26]

according to time and place, and who will be sensibly talking according to time 
and place, those princes then spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. [1-30-1]

"Oh, god, we are interested to listen at which time those night-walkers come to 
disturb the ritual, and at which time we have to safeguard the ritual from them, 
that you tell us, let not that moment pass away." [1-30-2]

All the sages available there are delighted with the princes of Kakutstha dynasty 
who are speaking thus and making haste for a combat with demons and they praised 
them. [1-30-3]

"Oh, Raghava-s, you have to safeguard this ritual for six nights and days from today, 
and this Sage Vishvamitra who is under the vow of ritual goes into muteness as required 
by the vow." Thus said the other sages near at ritual place. [1-30-4]

On hearing that sentence of the other sages those two glorious princes have wakefully 
safeguarded that woodland of the ritual for six nights and days. [1-30-5]

On alertly patrolling nearby the Altar of Fire those two enemy-destroyers who are 
the wielders of great bows and valiant ones have protected the best sage Vishvamitra. 
[1-30-6]

While that period of six days is elapsing and when the sixth day has come, then 
Rama said to Saumitri, "you be prepared and be on alert." [1-30-7]

While Rama is saying thus himself quickening to combat then the fire in the Altar 
of Fire flared up suddenly and highly, brightening the chief officiator of the ritual, 
namely Vishvamitra, and other priests around it. [1-30-8]

The Altar of Fire around which sacred grass, drink-vessels, oblation spoons, firewood-sticks, 
and heaps of flowers are kept, and around which Vishvamitra and the conductors of 
ritual are sitting, that altar flared high. [1-30-9]

While the Vedic ritual is proceeding well towards its conclusion according to hymnal 
rendering and rules of conducting the ritual, a strident and frightening blare is 
generated in the sky. [1-30-10]

As to how massive clouds appear in torrential cloudburst, likewise two demons appeared 
enshrouding the sky, and performing wizardry they are about to swoop down towards 
the Altar of Fire. [1-30-11]

Maareecha and Subaahu are the monstrous demons that have come along with their followers 
and they have started to pour down spates of blood. [1-30-12]

On noticing the Altar of Fire swamped with streams of blood, then Rama swiftly ran 
towards that direction and saw the demons in the sky. [1-30-13]

Perceiving that the two demons are about to swoop down on Altar of Fire in haste, 
that lotus-eyed Rama however gave a quick checking look at Lakshmana saying this 
sentence. [1-30-14]

"Lakshmana, I am reluctant to eliminate this kind of these ill-behaved and raw flesh 
eating demons, but no doubt, they will be puffed out with Manava missile like a 
gust puffing thick clouds, you may see." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [1-30-15, 
16a]

Saying so that agile Rama fitted the very benign and highly radiant arrow Maanava 
on his bow, and taking aim with it at Maareecha that highly furious Raghava darted 
it on the chest of Maareecha. [1-30-16b, 17]

Cleanly hit with that great missile Maanava, demon Maareecha is pitched for a hundred 
yojana lengths in full, and flung down into an ocean rocking with tidewaters. [1-30-18]

On seeing him highly whirling, rendered insensate and thrown out when rammed away 
with the strength of that Cold arrow Rama said this to Lakshmana. [1-30-19]

"Lakshmana, see the Cold arrow belonging to Maanava missile expounded by Manu which 
is taking him away on baffling, but without taking away his life. [1-30-20]

"But I wish to kill these demons for they are ruthless, iniquitous, flagitious, 
ritual-hinderers and blood-drinkers." So said Rama to Lakshmana. [1-30-21]

Thus saying to Lakshmana, as though to show his swift dexterity Rama, the descendent 
of Raghu dynasty, took up a very powerful missile called Aagneya astra, Fire-missile, 
and darted it on the chest of Subaahu, by which that demon Subaahu is struck and 
fell flat on ground. [1-30-22]

In order to bring felicity to the sages that great glorious and supremely generous 
Raghava took up the missile of Air-god and hit down the remaining demons. [1-30-23]

When Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, has eliminated all of the demons that 
are the hinderers of Vedic rituals, the sages available there in that hermitage 
idealised him as Indra was idealised once, when he became victories on demons. [1-30-24]

On the completion of ritual beholding the precincts that are devoid of calamities 
the great sage Vishvamitra said this to Rama. [1-30-25]

"My purpose in conducting the ritual is fully realised, oh, dextrous Rama, and you 
too, as a highly illustrious prince, have actualised the word of honour of your 
mentor, where one mentor is your father King Dasharatha and the other is myself, and 
likewise oh, valiant Rama the glory of this Accomplished hermitage is also actualised..." 
thus when Vishvamitra is applauding Rama, they have come close to vesper-time for 
vespertine prayers on Sandhya, the goddess of gloaming. [1-30-26]

On hearing that sentence of Rama of Jamadagni, then Rama of Dasharatha said this to him in a courtly owing to the presence 
of his father Dasharatha. [1-76-1]

Oh, Bhaargava Rama, whatsoever endeavour you have strived for freeing yourself from the indebtedness towards your father, 
I have heard of them, and oh, Brahman, we appreciate for your achieving that freeness from your paternal debt, but... [1-76-2]

"Oh, Bhaargava Rama, demeaning me as though I am timorous, hence incapable to handle the bow, and hence I am an ignoble 
one for Kshatriya-hood, is meaningless... come on, now you may see my spiritedness and sprightliness..." So said Rama to 
Bhaargava. [1-76-3]

Raghava, the nimble-handed vanquisher of his opponents, speaking thus in high dudgeon expropriated that estimable weapon, 
namely the longbow of Vishnu, from the hand of Bhaargava Rama, along with the long-arrow that is already fitted on it... 
[1-76-4]

On lifting up the bow that is already fitted with an arrow on bowstring, then Rama started to take aim with it, but being 
indecisive about the target, then Rama of Dasharatha irefully said this to Rama of Jamagadni. [1-76-5]

Oh Rama of Bhaargava, even if you are a Brahman you are eliminable, but because of your relationship with Vishvamitra, 
and because you are a venerable one for me, I am disinclined to release this arrow that exterminates your life... [1-76-6]

Oh Bhaargava Rama, either this motility of yours at the speed of your mind, or even those unparalleled realms of heavens 
which you have earned by the power of your ascesis, I will eliminate whichever you wish... [1-76-7]

"This Vishnu's divine arrow is the conqueror of opponents' citadels, and a vanquisher of their vigour and vainglory, and 
it will not fall through wastefully... isn't it!" So said archer Rama to axeman Rama. [1-76-8]

Gods together with the assemblages of sages have come keeping the Grandparent Brahma at their fore, likewise the gandharva-s, 
apsara-s, siddha-s, caarana-s, kinnaraa-s, yaksha-s, sprites and reptilian beings have also come to see Rama who is now 
wielding the extraordinary longbow of Vishnu, and extremely amazing event that is going to ensue. [1-76-9, 10]

Then, when Rama is ready to take aim with the arrow on that inscrutable longbow, and when the worlds are being rendered 
as insentient, then that Rama of Jamadagni is rendered vigourless and he stared up at Rama of Dasharatha. [1-76-11]

Rama of Jamadagni is calloused as his vitality is subdued by the radiance of that lotus-petal eyed Rama of Dasharatha, and 
he spoke to Rama of Dasharatha, slowly and softly. [1-76-12]

Once, when I donated entire earth to Sage Kashyapa, Kashyapa told me 'uninhabitable is my domain, viz., this earth for 
you...' thus... [1-76-13]

Such as I was, in my observance of my mentor Kashyapa's order I do not spend nights on this earth from then afterwards, 
oh, Kakutstha Rama, as I made over this earth for Kashyapa, indeed... [1-76-14]

Thereby oh, valiant one, it will be inapt of you to impair this motility of mine, oh, Raghava, I will depart with the speed 
of cerebration to Mt. Mahendra, a par excellent mountain... [1-76-15]

But I triumphed over matchless realms of heavens with my ascesis, oh, Rama, you may hash them up with that irreversible 
arrow... let there be no time-lag... [1-76-16]

I have realized your touch of nature as that of the Immutable Supreme Being, God of Gods, the Exterminator of the demon 
Madhu, namely Vishnu, by the touch of your handling that bow... oh, enemy-inflamer, blessedness alone betides you... [1-76-17]

All of these gods who have come collectively are beholding you and your next move, for you are an unequalled one in your 
achievements and to whom there is no counter-dueller in conflicts... [1-76-18]

Oh, Kakutstha Rama, you are the lord of the triad of worlds, such as you are, you faced me down, and it is malapropos to 
say that this is a disgrace to me... [1-76-19]

"It will be apt of you to unloose that unsurpassed arrow, oh, Rama, as you have ethical commitment to wipe out demons as 
I wiped out menacing kings, and should you unloosen that arrow now I wish to depart to the ethereal mountain Mt. Mahendra, 
a point of no return for me..." So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. [1-76-20]

While Rama of Jamadagni is speaking that way, that venturesome and blessed Rama of Dasharatha shot off that nonpareil arrow 
from that longbow of Vishnu. [1-76-21]

On seeing all of his realms of heavens are shot-blasted by Rama of Dasharatha, Rama of Jamadagni vanished in a trice to 
Mt. Mahendra, the heavenly mountain. [1-76-22]

Then dissipated is the darkness in all the divisions and likewise in all the subdivisions of compass, and the gods with 
the assemblages of sages extolled Rama, in whose hands the longbow is upraised. [1-76-23]

Then that dab hand at axe, Rama of Jamadagni, on acclaiming, and even on making circumambulations to Rama of Dasharatha, 
went on his own way into oblivion. [1-76-24]

			On hearing that sentence of scholarly Kushanaabha those hundred 
			girls touched his feet with their foreheads and spoke to him. [1-33-1]

			" 'The all-pervasive Air-god desired to dishonour us, oh, king, resorting 
			to improper approach and overlooking virtuous conduct. [1-33-2]

			" 'Our father is there and we are not independent, you be safe, hence 
			oh, Air-god, you may request our father to know whether he gives us 
			to you or not.' Thus we have told the Air-god, but... [1-33-3]

			" 'Though we all have spoken to him thus, that Air-god who is bound 
			by venality refused to take notice of our words and he has harmed us 
			a lot.' Thus those girls informed their father. [1-33-4]

			On listening their words that highly virtuous and highly resplendent 
			king spoke to the hundred girls with unsurpassed virtue. [1-33-5]

			" 'Forgiving is the duty of imperturbable and you have done it. Excellent. 
			Oh, daughters, coursing through your unity my family's prestige is also 
			kept up. [1-33-6]

			" 'Forgiveness is an adornment to women, as a matter of fact, even for 
			men, and this matter called 'forgiving' that which is there, it is an 
			impracticable affair. That too, in respect of divinities. And the kind 
			of forgiveness you all possess uniformly, that is further laudable. 
			[1-33-7, 8a]

			" 'Grace is altruism, grace is ritualism, oh, my daughters, grace is 
			glory, grace is virtue, and this universe is verily abiding in graciousness 
			alone for grace itself is the truth, isn't it!' Thus king Kushanaabha 
			said to his daughters and sent them away. [1-33-8b, 9a]

			"On leaving those girls, oh, Rama, that king whose valour matches that 
			of gods and who is an expert in thinking strategies started to think 
			with his ministers on the topics like, as to how his daughters are to 
			be espoused to, to which country they are to be sent, at which time 
			marriage shall happen, and to which matching bridegroom the marriage 
			is to be proposed, and so on." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. 
			[1-33-9b, 10]

			During that time a great-resplendent sage named Cuulii is there, who 
			is propitious in his demeanour and who holds his semen upward, and who 
			has achieved high ascetic practise strictly according to Vedic canons. 
			[1-33-11]

"While that sage is in the practise of asceticism a celestial female served 
him at the place of his ascesis, safety be with you oh, Rama, she is Somada by her 
name, the daughter of Urmila. [1-33-12]

			"Even she is obedient in his respect, and dedicating herself in ministering 
			to him she stayed there righteously. After some time that sage Cuulii 
			has become satisfied with her service. [1-33-13]

			"When her service is fructified, oh, Rama, that sage benevolently spoke 
			to her saying, 'I am perfectly pleased with your service, let good betide 
			you, what cherish of yours I have to fulfil.' [1-33-14]

			"Perceiving that the sage is contented that female celestial Somada 
			who is aware of making good sentences is highly delighted and spoke 
			with her melodious voice to that pedantic sage. [1-33-15]

			" 'Vedic splendour is flourishing in you when you have become one with 
			Brahma, oh, supreme ascetic, I may please be endowed with a righteous 
			son whose ascetic spirituality may embody the spirituality enunciated 
			in Veda-s. [1-33-16]

			" 'I am unmarried and nobody's wife, safe you be, and as I took shelter 
			under your kindness it will be apt of you to endow me a son with your 
			faculty of asceticism.' So said Somada to sage Cuulii. [1-33-17]

			"That Brahma-sage Cuuli benignantly bestowed her with a unique and 
			Brahma-like son who is renowned as Brahmadatta, as well as his own brainchild. 
			[1-33-18]

			"King Brahmadatta endued with superb grandeur ruled from a city called 
			Kaampilya as with Indra ruling the heaven. [1-33-19]

			"The most righteous king Kushanaabha then made up his mind, oh, Rama 
			of Kakutstha, to espouse his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta. [1-33-20]

			"Inviting Brahmadatta that great-resplendent lord of the land, namely 
			the king Kushanaabha, married his hundred daughters to him, pleasing 
			highly in his heart of hearts. [1-33-21]

			"As with the tradition of marriage king Brahmadatta who vies with lord 
			of gods, namely Indra, in succession took the palm of each of the hundred 
			girls into his palm. [1-33-22]

			"By mere touch of hand of Brahmadatta alone, their misshape and desperation 
			are evanished, and all of those hundred maidens beamed bright as they 
			are retouched with utmost elegance. [1-33-23]

			"On seeing his daughters getting release from the effect of Air-god 
			Kushanaabha became highly joyful, and he took great delight time and 
			again as and when he looked at them. [1-33-24]

			"Later when the marriage is complete king Kushanaabha bade farewell 
			to king Brahmadatta along with his wives, his own hundred daughters, 
			and along with the groups of religious teachers. [1-33-25]

			"Somada, the celestial female and the mother of Brahmadatta, is gladdened 
			to see her son Brahmadatta, for the worthwhile deed done by him in removing 
			the blemish caused by the Air-god to the girls, or in bringing those 
			worthwhile girls as her daughter-in-laws. She is further gladdened while 
			her feet are traditionally and repeatedly touched by a hundred daughter-in-laws 
			in succession, coupled with her own raising of each of the daughter-in-law 
			to embrace for a hundred times. Thus Somada has gone on caressing each 
			of her hundred daughter-in-laws, and in doing so she is gladdened to 
			do so over and over again, she is gladdened. She thus praised Kushanaabha 
			for giving his gemlike daughters as her daughter-in-laws and blessed 
			the daughter-in-laws. [1-33-26]

"When Sage Vashishta did not yield Kaamadhenu, the milker of any desire, oh, Rama, 
then Vishvamitra started to seize it." Sage Shataananda continued the narration 
of the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-54-1]

While the determined king Vishvamitra dragged her away from Vashishta, oh, Rama, 
Shabala is saddened and tearfully mulled over stung by the anguish of her secession 
from the sage. [1-54-2]

A pitiable and highly anguished one, such as I am. I am being dragged away by 
the servants of the king. Has this great souled Sage Vashishta abandoned me, or 
what? [1-54-3]

'Or, did I do any misdeed towards that great sage of sacred soul whereby he is 
leaving me off. I have always been reverent and a cherished cow to that priest 
and am I no errant.' That cow eulogised in this manner. [1-54-4]

On thinking thus and suspiring repeatedly, oh, enemy-subjugator, Rama, then she 
that Sacred Cow hastily rushed with the speed a gust and went to that highly energetic 
Vashishta on utterly shoving off hundreds of attendants of the king who are roping 
her, and then she straight went to the base of the feet of the great-souled Vashishta. 
[1-54-5, 6]

She that moaning and groaning Shabala staying before the Sage Vashishta spoke this 
bellowing like a thunderous cloud. [1-54-7]

'Oh, Son of Brahma, why I am discarded by you, whereby oh, god, the king's attendants 
are weaning me away from your proximity.' So Shabala urged Vashishta. [1-54-8]

When he is spoken thus, then that Brahma-sage spoke this sentence to worrisome 
Shabala, whose heart is worrying with worry, as he would speak with his own sister 
in her worriment. [1-54-9]

Neither I forswear you nor you fouled me, oh, Shabala, this king is forcibly 
weaning you away from me as he is beside himself with kingly arrogance. [1-54-10]

'My ability is not balanceable with his, isn't it. Above all, on his part he is 
a king now, and a king will be mighty, he is the lord of the land and a Kshatriya, 
and thus we have to be subservient to a Kshatriya, isn't it. [1-54-11]

'This <font color="#B3003A">akShauhiNi</font> unit of army is plethoric, overcrowded 
with elephants, horses, and chariots, and overspread with flags and elephants, thereby 
he is mightier than me.' Thus Vashishta tried to pacify that Sacred-Cow. [1-54-12]

She who is spoken that way by Vashishta, that sententious Sacred Cow, Shabala, 
in her turn obediently spoke this sentence to that Brahma-sage of un-balanceable 
resplendence. [1-54-13]

'Oh, Brahman, unstated is that the might of sovereignty as mightier than the might 
of sagacity. A sage is mightier than a sovereign. A sage's might is mightiest than 
the mightier sovereign, for a sage's might is angelic.' So Shabala started talking 
to the sage. [1-54-14]

Immutable is your power as you are mightier than great-mighty Vishvamitra and 
invincible is your dynamism. [1-54-15]

'Ordain me, oh, highly resplendent sage, who am replete with the power of your 
sagacity, and I will disprove the vanity, valour, and venture of that injudicious 
king for this injudicious seizure.' Thus Shabala implored the sage Vashishta. [1-54-16]

Oh, Rama, when spoken by her thus, that highly glorious Vashishta said to Shabala, 
the do-all cow, 'create a power that can overpower the power of opponent.' Vashishta 
said so to Shabala.[1-54-17]

On hearing his sentence, oh, Rama, that Sacred Cow Shabala then created Pahlava 
kings, sprang forth from her mooing 'hums', and hundreds of them annihilated the 
army of Vishvamitra in its entirety just while Vishvamitra is witnessing it. [1-54-18, 
19a]

King Vishvamitra was utterly infuriated and with wide-eyed anger he started to 
destroy those Pahlava-s with many a kind of his weaponry. [1-54-19b, 20a]

On seeing the subdual of hundreds of Pahlava-s by Vishvamitra, then the Sacred 
Cow again generated deadly Shaka-s hobnobbed with Yavana-s through her mooing 'hums'. 
[1-54-20b, 21a]

Then the earth was pervaded with the Shaka-s associated with Yavana-s, who have 
effectuation and bravery in overcoming their enemy forces, and who are golden in 
bodily colour similar to the golden pistils of flowers which complexion is outlandish. 
[1-54- 21b, 22a]

Yavana-s and Shaka-s, who are wielding bowie knives and broad lances and who are 
clad in golden coloured dresses, and who looked like glowing fires have completely 
burnt down entire force of Vishvamitra. [1-54-22, 23a]

"Then that great-resplendent Vishvamitra indeed released his missiles, by which 
Yavana-s, Kaambhoja-s, and the Barbara-s, are rendered helter-skelter." Thus Sage 
Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra. [1-54-23b,c.]

King Dasharatha requests the Sages to conduct the Vedic ritual for which the sages indent paraphernalia, 
which the ministers are ordered to supply forthwith. This chapter is almost a replication of chapter 
8, excepting the inclusion of references to Sage Rishyasringa who by now is available in Ayodhya.

After a lapse some time when spring season has come the king Dasharatha desired to perform the Vedic 
ritual. [1-12-1]

Then bowing his head before that Brahmana sage Rishyasringa whose is glow is like that of a deity, King 
Dasharatha verily beseeched that sage to conduct Vedic ritual on his behalf as he wished to beget progeny 
to maintaining his family line. [1-12-2]

Sage Rishyasringa who by now is well-honoured by the king said to the king, "So it shall be, let the 
paraphernalia for ritual be garnered and let your ritual horse be released as a prerogative and 
let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." [1-12-3]

Then King Dasharatha said to his best minister Sumantra, "Let the Vedic scholars and ritual conductors 
like Sages Suyajna, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali, and Kaashyapa, along with the family priest Vashishta, as well 
as other Vedic Brahmans that are there, they all be invited swiftly..." [1-12-4, 5, 6a]

Then Sumantra being a quickest person went quickly and fetched all those Vedic scholars and clergymen. 
Then the virtuous king Dasharatha having offered due worships to all the sages and saints brought in 
by Sumantra, uttered these words which are with virtue and meaning, in an impressible manner. [1-12-6, 
7, 8a]

"My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... hence I am thinking of performing the 
Vedic Horse Ritual for progeny... I wish to perform the ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and by 
strict observances... I wish to get my desires fulfilled through the divine influence of the Sage's 
son, Rishyasringa... [1-12-8, 9, 10a]

Then "Splendid, splendid is this idea," said the Brahmana scholars blessing the king. Then Sage Vashishta 
along with all other important personalities have applauded the idea that has come out of the king's 
voice, and all those Vedic scholars and clerj~nmen keeping Rishyasringa at helm of affairs said this 
to the king, in appreciation of that idea. [1-12-10b, 11]

"Because a virtuous thinking of begetting sons through Vedic ritual has come to you, you will by all 
means get four sons with boundless valour... let ritual paraphernalia be garnered and let your ritual-horse 
be released and let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." 
The Vedic seers thus blessed Dasharatha. [1-12-12, 13]

Then the king is gladdened to hear the blessing advises of the Vedic scholars, and he spoke to the other 
ministers of his court, with happiness derived from those good words. [1-12-14]

The king said to his executives, "As advised by my Vedic teachers, let the paraphernalia for my ritual 
be procured... let the ritual-horse be released, guarded well by gallant men in its journey... and let 
religious teachers follow that horse as per tradition... let the ritual place be decided on the northern 
banks of Sarayu River... let the peace invocations be prevailing and prospering throughout as ordained 
in the scriptures and tradition... all the kings on this earth would have performed this Horse Ritual, 
if only they can perform this without a mistake... thus, this is a great and difficult ritual... the 
Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults performed in the rituals whereat they can inteject themselves 
in to the proceedings of the ritual in order to ruin it... further, the performer of the ritual also 
gets ruined if there were be to be faults... that is why this ritual shall be conducted faultlessly 
till its conclusion, and with absolute adherence to the scriptures... since all of you assembled here 
are efficient ones in conducting such rituals without faults, I hope you all will organise carefully.... 
[1-12-15,16,17,18, 19]

In appreciation of his orders all the ministers replied the king saying "it will be done accordingly..." 
and indeed they have faultlessly carried out works as ordered. [1-12-20]

Then all the Brahmans applauded the virtuous king and who is like a Sacred Bull among the kings for 
his virtuous endeavour of undertaking the Vedic ritual, and with his permission all of them returned 
from there as they have come. [1-12-21]

On the departure of the prominent Brahmans, King Dasharatha sent off those ministers who are still available 
there for further orders from the king, and then he the great resplendent king has entered his own palace. 
[1-12-22]

And seasons are twelve and every two months is a season, and they are calculated by almanacs basing

			When that sage Vishvamitra has finished narration of the legend of the 
			daughters of Himavanta, both the brave ones, namely Raghava and Lakshmana 
			in their turn have extolled that legend and spoke to that eminent-sage. 
			[1-36-1]

			"This admirable discourse given by you about Ganga is exhaustive in 
			righteousness, oh, Brahman, and it will be apt of you to tell emphatically 
			about the divine and earthly legend of the elder daughter of Himavanta, 
			namely Ganga, for you are aware to expatiate upon it. [1-36-2]

			"By which reason that world purifier Ganga influxes into three paths? 
			Oh, virtue-knower, and connected with which deeds of merit this triple-courser 
			Ganga is renowned as the best one among all the rivers in three worlds?" 
			Thus Rama and Lakshmana have asked the sage Vishvamitra. [1-36-3, 4a]

			When Kakutstha-s have enquired that way, the ascetically-wealthy sage 
			Vishvamitra has narrated all the legend of Ganga in its entirety, staying 
			among the sages. [1-36-4b, 5a]

			"On his getting married to Uma, oh, Rama, the sublime-ascetic and bluish 
			throated god Shiva, as his throat became blue when he consumed poison 
			during the churning of Milky Ocean, at one time with a predilection 
			towards her he has started lovemaking with her. [1-36-5b, 6a]

			"While that sublime, sagacious and blue-throated God Shiva is in lovemaking, 
			oh, enemy-scorcher Rama, a hundred divine years have elapsed, even then 
			he had no son in her, namely Goddess Uma. [1-36-6b, c, 7]

			"All the gods headed by Brahma have then started to ponder, 'is there 
			anybody who can inevitably sustain that being which emerges from this 
			goddess Uma after this prolonged yogic act of copulation with Shiva?' 
			This being the worry of all gods they have prepared for action. [1-36-7b, 
			8a]

			"All of the gods on approaching and paying their deference to Shiva 
			spoke this to him, 'oh, God of Gods, oh, one who is interested in the 
			welfare of these worlds, oh, Great-God, considering the supplication 
			of all gods it will be apt of you to bestow grace.' [1-36-8b, 9]

			" 'Worlds cannot capably bear your offspring born out of your effulgence, 
			oh, Supreme-God, hence you may practice yogic asceticism along with 
			your consort Goddess Uma in unison with Vedic postulates of Yoga, rather 
			than progeniture, and desiring the welfare of the three worlds you may 
			please retain your refulgent seed within your own radiance, thus protect 
			this universe, since it will not be apt of you to render it devoid of 
			worlds with the efflux of the unmanageable potence of yours .' So said 
			gods to Shiva. [1-36-10, 11]

			"On listening the words of gods that Rarefied-God of Universe, namely 
			Shiva said, 'so be it,' and further spoke this to all of the gods, indeed. 
			[1-36-12]

			" 'I wish to bear my sperm in my virility and Uma in hers, let the immortals 
			and mortals as well, derive a perfect bliss. [1-36-13]

			" 'But that part which has already stirred up from its place is irrestrainable, 
			as such, oh gods of eminence, you tell me who can contain that part 
			of the unexcelled potence.' So said Shiva to gods. [1-36-14]

			"Thus spoken by Shiva, then the gods in reply spoke to him whose banner 
			is Divine-Bull, namely Shiva, 'that part of the potence which has already 
			stirred up, the earth indeed endures that now. [1-3-15]

			"Thus said by the gods that Yogi of par excellence and the God of Gods, 
			Shiva, discharged his refulgent semen with which the earth together 
			with its mountains and forests is overspread. [1-36-16]

			"Thereby the gods in their turn said even to Fire-god, 'you enter the 
			great-potence of Rudra along with Wind-god, lest that potence may annihilate 
			the earth and earthlings, because you can consume anything that comes 
			in touch with you. [1-36-17]

			"And when Fire-god invaded that great-potence of Shiva it has emerged 
			as White-mountain, also thus it has become as a divine forest of reeds 
			equalling the Sun and Fire in its resplendence, wherefrom the highly 
			brilliant Kumara has emerged. [1-36-18, 19a]

			"Later on, the gods together with the assemblages of sages are well 
			pleased at heart as it has happened according to their prayer, thereby 
			they fulsomely adored Shiva and even Uma. [1-36-19b, 20a]

			"Oh, Rama, but the daughter of Himalayan Mountain, namely Uma, while 
			irefully saying this to the divinities she cursed them all with her 
			eyes reddened in anger. [1-36-20b, 21a]

			" 'Wherefore, I who am desirous of a son had been prevented from the 
			intimacy with my husband, therefore you shall be infecund to beget progeny 
			through your own wives. [1-36-21b, 22a]

			" 'And from now onwards you wives shall remain infertile...' and on 
			saying this way to all of the gods she also gave a curse to the earth. 
			[1-36-22, 23a]

			" 'Oh, Earth, your appearance shall be bizarre and you will be a wife 
			to many. And oh, verily base-minded earth, rendered sully by my anger 
			you shall have no gratification caused by the children as you are bigoted 
			against my son. [1-36-23b, 24]

			"That God of Gods Shiva becoming ill at ease to look at all of the distressed 
			gods, equally feeling small to convince his consort Uma, he has started 
			to journey towards the western quarter which is ruled by Rain-god. [1-36-25]

			"On going to the northern side of Himalayan Mountains, that God of Gods, 
			Shiva settled down in ascesis along with his consort Uma on the peak 
			of a mountain emerged from Himalayas. [1-36-26]

			"This is the legend of mountain's daughter, namely Goddess Uma vividly 
			narrated to you, oh, Rama, and now listen from me along with Lakshmana 
			about the emergence of Ganga. [1-36-27]

On seeing at that best sage among best meditators Sage Vashishta, the great-mighty and valorous Vishvamitra 
is highly rejoiced and obediently made an obeisance to the sage. [1-52-1]

The great-souled Vashishta spoke, "you are welcome," and that godly sage has indeed shown a high seat 
to Vishvamitra. [1-52-2]

The eminent saint Vashishta then customarily offered fruits and tuber to the courageous Vishvamitra 
who by now has assumed a seat. [1-52-3]

On receiving that deference from Vashishta, then that unsurpassed king Vishvamitra asked after the well-being 
of the ascesis, Fire-rituals and disciples and their progress in that hermitage, and that great-resplendent 
Vishvamitra has also asked after the well being of flora and fauna of the hermitage, and Vashishta reported 
to the matchless king about the all round well-being of every activity. [1-52-4, 5]

Vashishta the supreme one among meditators, a great-ascetic, and the brainchild of Brahma has then asked 
Vishvamitra who is sitting at ease. [1-52-6]

I hope that you are fine! And oh, righteous king, hope that you are ruling people righteously with 
kingly righteousness to their contentment. [1-52-7]

I hope your servants are looked after well, hope all of them are abiding by the rulership, oh, vanquisher 
of adversaries, I hope that you have surely vanquished all of your adversaries. [1-52-8]

"For you are an impeccable one and an emery-inflamer, oh, tigerly-man, I hope that your forces, exchequer 
and confederates are fine, and all is well with your sons and grandsons." Thus Vashishta asked the well-being 
of Vishvamitra. [1-52-9]

The great-resplendent king Vishvamitra respectfully replied Sage Vashishta saying, 'everything 
is fine.' [1-52-10]

Both of those celebrities of conscientious then exchanged pleasantries for a long time with their rejoice 
heightening and gladdening one another. [1-52-11]

Then at the end of discussions, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, that godly Sage Vashishta smilingly 
spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. [1-52-12]

I wish to offer guestship befitting to your status, oh, great-forceful king Vishvamitra, to a matchless 
one like you and to this military force of yours, kindly accept it from me. [1-52-13]

'You may kindly accept all these hospitalities offered by me, oh king, for you are an important guest 
you ought to be reverenced effortfully.' So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-52-14]

When sage Vashishta said in this way, that highly-intellectual king Vishvamitra said to him, 'hospitality 
is deemed to have been offered to me with your reverential words, it is enough and nothing more is necessary.' 
[1-52-15]

I am entertained with whatever item that obtains in your hermitage, say fruits, tubers and water 
for feet-wash and to wet mouth. Why those petty items, I regaled just by seeing you, a godly sage like. 
Oh, highly noetic sage, by yourself you are a sage worthy to be reverenced by one and all, such as you 
are you alone have reverenced me. Now I wish to take leave, please accept my obeisance to you, and please 
look upon us with a friendlily regard. [1-52-16, 17]

Even if the king was speaking in this way obliquely to him, that virtue-souled and magnanimous sage 
Vashishta entreated the king repeatedly. [1-52-18]

Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra then replied the eminent saint Vashishta, "Agreed! As it pleases the godly 
sage. So be it!" [1-52-19]

When Vishvamitra said that way then Vashishta, the best one among meditators, and one whose blemishes 
are laved is gladdened, and started calling his speckled cow, namely Shabala, yclept Kaamadhenu. [1-52-20]

Come on, oh, Shabala! Come quickly and listen to my words. I prepared to accord hospitality with 
a highly delectable royal banquet to this kingly sage together with all his forces. You arrange it for 
me. [1-52-21]

Oh, Kaamadhenu, the Divine Cow, the Milker of All-Desires, for my sake you shower whatsoever foodstuff 
is savoured by whosoever according to one's own piquancy from each of the six savour, that too plentifully. 
[1-52-22]

" 'Oh, Shabala, you create heaps of savourily foodstuffs comprised of masticable items like crunchy 
foods, drinkable items like soft-drinks, tasteable items like honey-like viscous dishes, squeezable 
items like pulpy fruits, and be quick.' " So said Sage Vashishta to that Sacred Cow, Kaamadhenu, and 
Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-52-23]

Then the eminent-saint Vishvamitra together with Vashishta said these words to Janaka, the valiant king of Videha, who has 
just said about his lineage. [1-72-1]

The Ikshvaku-s and Videha-s are unimaginably admirable and immeasurably distinguished dynasties, oh, Janaka, the best one 
among all men, there is no single king comparable to one from these dynasties... [1-72-2]

Oh, king Janaka, these espousals of Seetha with Rama and Urmila with Lakshmana is behovely to each other's dynastical prestige 
and even it is befitting to the winsome charms of the brides and bridegrooms, but that being so... [1-72-3]

Oh, grand sire, you may listen to my words of advise... this younger brother of yours, king Kushadhvaja, is at home in 
every kind of probity... [1-72-4]

Oh, king, the pair of daughters of this right-minded Kushadhvaja is nonpareil in comeliness in this world, hence, oh, grand 
sire, we choose to pair them off with Bharata and Shatrughna... [1-72-5]

Oh, king, for the sake of those two honourable boys, for that young man Bharata and for that smart man Shatrughna, we opt 
your brother's daughters... [1-72-6]

All these four sons of Dasharatha have handsomeness and youthfulness, and they are equal to the four rulers of the world 
from four quarters, and their valour vies with the valour of God Vishnu... [1-72-7]

"Oh, best king, let both these dynasties of yours, the impeccable dynasty of Ikshvaku-s and the immaculate dynasty of yours 
as well, be interlocked by these wedlock-s..." Thus Vishvamitra advised Janaka. [1-72-8]

On hearing the words of Vishvamitra that have the concurrence of Vashishta then Janaka reverently said this to those two 
eminent-saints. [1-72-9]

By which reason you two eminent-saints personally bid fair to this befitting proposal, thereby I opine that my dynasty 
is highly honoured... [1-72-10]

So be it! Safe betides you all! Let the pair of Kushdhvaja's daughters, namely Maandavi, Shrutakiirti, devout themselves 
as a pair of wives to the paired brothers, namely Bharata and Shatrughna, respectively... [1-72-11]

Oh, eminent-saint Vishvamitra, let the palms of four princesses be taken in the palms of these four mettlesome princes 
in marriage, in the light of one day... [1-72-12]

"Oh, Brahman, the savants acclaim that part of the day as the best for wedding ceremonies when both of the pre-Phalguni 
and post-Phalguni stars are available, and on such a time where post-Phalguni is ruling, for which Bhaga is the presiding 
deity for progeny..." So said Janaka to the marriage party. [1-72-13]

On saying those gracious words thus, king Janaka got up from his throne and coming nigh of both of the eminent-saints, Vishvamitra 
and Vashishta, reverently said this sentence. [1-72-14]

You two, oh, eminent-saints, have done an excellent generous act in my respect, thus I will ever remain your proselyte... 
you may please preside over these thrones, that of mine, my brother's, and that of Dasharatha... [1-72-15]

"As to how this city Mithila appertains to Dasharatha, in the same way city of Ayodhya is mine... and there shall be no 
hesitancy for you two sages in governance on these three kingdoms, thus it will be apt of you to make the marriages happen 
as aptly as you can..." So said Janaka to the sages. [1-72-16]

The legatee of Raghu-s king Dasharatha is gladdened while the legatee of Videha is talking in such a hobnobbing way, and 
he replied king Janaka in this way. [1-72-17]

Oh, kings of Mithila, Janaka and Kushadhvaja, you two brothers have reverenced inestimable sages and coteries of kings, 
as such inestimable good manners are treasured in both of you... [1-72-18]

"Enjoy that blessedness! Let safe betide you! We now depart to our visitatorial-palace, and we shall customarily carry out 
the tributary rituals..." Dasharatha said thus. [1-72-19]

On seeking leave of absence from the sovereign of people, Janaka, that highly renowned king Dasharatha promptly departed 
from there, keeping both of the eminent-saints afore, namely Vishvamitra and Vashishta. [1-72-20]

King Dasharatha on going to his visitatorial-palace has procedurally undertaken the tributary rituals, and on getting up 
in the next morning, he carried out the initiatory rituals of marriages, in a grand way, in which donation of cows is a 
part. [1-72-21]

That lord of people king Dasharatha has righteously donated hundred thousand cows to Brahman-s, in the name of each of his 
four sons. [1-72-22]

In that cow donation ceremony intended for his sons, he that best one among men and the one who is affectionate towards 
his sons, Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, has donated on behalf of each of his sons, four hundred thousand cows, that 
are abundant milkers, and that have golden casings on their horns, and that are with their calves, and along with milking 
jugs made with bell metal, and he even donated very many other kinds of assets to Brahmans. [1-72-23, 24]

On performing the cow donations and <font color="#B3003A">samaavartana, snaataka</font>, the initiatory ceremonies of his 
sons, as well, he that serene king Dasharatha who is amidst the quartet of his sons, shone forth like serene Brahma, who 
is quartet-faced, with the quartet of Veda-s, and who is the overlord of mankind, amidst the quartet of presiding deities 
in the quartet of the world. [1-72-25]

			"On hearing the words of gods, the esteemed Forefather Brahma spoke 
			to them, who are very highly scared, and bewildered by the might of 
			Sagara's sons for they are effectuating the end of all beings." Vishvamitra 
			thus continued his narration. [1-40-1]

			To whom this Mother Earth belongs in all her entirety, he is that 
			prescient Vasudeva, and she is also the consort of that Maadhava, and 
			that Vishnu eternally props up Mother Earth. Hence, that reverential 
			Vishnu donning the semblance of Sage Kapila will burn down the sons 
			of emperor Sagara to ashes in a fire of fury. [1-40-2, 3]

			'Even the complete cleavage of the earth, and the complete ruination 
			of Sagara's sons as well, are envisaged by the providentially farsighted 
			ancients." So said Brahma to gods. [1-40-4]

			On hearing the words of the Forefather Brahma all the thirty three 
			gods went away with utmost satisfaction, as they have came. [1-40-5]

			When the sons of Sagara are digging the earth then there emerged an 
			unbearable noise similar to the crashing of a thunder. [1-40-6]

			Then on hollowing the entire earth, and on making trips around her 
			without finding the horse, all of the sons of Sagara have come together 
			and on going to their father they spoke these words to him. [1-40-7]

			'Entire earth is trekked and mighty beings like gods, demons, monsters, 
			evil-spirits, fiends, serpents, naga-s are also eliminated, but we have 
			not seen the ritual-horse or its stealer. What we have to do next. Let 
			a thought be given in this matter. Let safeness betide you.' So said 
			those princes to their father Sagara. [1-40-8, 9]

			On hearing that sentence of his sons, oh, Rama, descendent of Raghu, 
			that exalted king Sagara infuriately spoke these words. [1-40-10]

			'Let the earth be dug further, may safety be with you, and verily 
			splitting open the surface of the earth you catch hold of the thief 
			of the horse, and on achieving your purpose you may return to me.' In 
			this way Sagara ordered his sons. [1-40-11]

			On catching up the words of their father, the great-souled Sagara, 
            his sixty thousand sons rushed towards the surface of the <strong>rasaatala</strong>, 
            the netherworld. [1-40-12]

			While digging the earth there they beheld a mountain similar easterly 
			elephant named Viruupaaksha, which is bearing the eastern side of earth's 
			surface on its head. [1-40-13]

			Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that great easterly elephant Viruupaaksha 
			is bearing the entire eastern earth along with its mountains and forests 
			on its head. [1-40-14]

			On certain occasions, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, when that great-elephant 
			moves its head desiring respite in tiresomeness then earthquakes will 
			occur on earth. [1-40-15]

			They circumambulated the great elephant in supplication, oh Rama, and 
			on worshipping that elephant which is the protector of easterly direction 
			they proceeded to netherworld duly splitting the earth. [1-40-16]

			After splitting the eastern direction then they split opened the southern 
			direction, and even in southern direction they beheld an elephant that 
			is similar to a very great mountain, and that is sustaining southerly 
			side of earth on its head, and on seeing that mammoth elephant of venerable 
			character, namely Mahapadma, they went into an inordinate astonishment. 
			[1-40-17, 18]

			On circumabulating that elephant Mahaapada in supplication, they the 
			sixty thousand sons of great-souled Sagara scooped out the westerly 
			direction. [1-40-19]

			Even in the westerly direction those great mighty sons of Sagara beheld 
			an infinite and mountain similar elephant of western direction, called 
			Sumanasa. [1-40-20]

			Circumambulating that elephant namely Sumanasa in western side, and 
			even on asking about its well-being, then they reached the northern 
			direction duly digging the earth. [1-40-21]

			In the northern direction, oh, Rama, they beheld Bhadra, a snow-white 
			elephant with an auspicious body bearing northern side of this earth. 
			[1-40-22]

			On touching that elephant reverently and also circumambulating it, 
			those sixty thousands sons of Sagara further burrowed to the surface 
			of the earth. [1-40-23]

			The sons of Sagara have then gone to the auspicious northeast direction,
			<font color="#B3003A">iishaana-digbhaaga, Shiva-sthaana</font>, and 
			all those sons of Sagara have tunnelled the earth rancorously. [1-40-24]

			But all those great-souled and great-mighty ones with terrible dash 
			have seen the Infinite Vasudeva in the form of sage Kapila there in 
			the northeast, and oh, descendant of Raghu, they have also seen the 
			ritual-horse moving nearby that sage Kapila, thus all of the sons of 
			Sagara obtained a matchless delight. [1-40-25, 26]

			The eyes of the princes are agitated in fury in construing the sage 
			Kapila as the stealer of ritual-horse, and they furiously dashed towards 
			him wielding crowbars, ploughs, and various trees and boulders, and 
			shouting at him, 'stay, stay.' [1-40-27, 28a]

			You the malicious one, you have indeed stolen our ritual-horse, and 
			in fact, you should know that we who arrived here are the sons of Sagara.' 
			Thus Sagara's sons shouted at sage Kapila. [1-40-28b, 29a]

			On hearing their words, oh, Rama, the descendant of Raghu, then sage 
			Kapila is beset with high wrath, and he boomed a 'hum' sound at them. 
			[1-40-29b, 30a]

			"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, then that great-souled sage Kapila, rather Vishnu 
			with unimaginable power, has rendered all of those sons of Sagara as 
			heaps of ashes by virtue of his 'hum' sound." Thus Sage Vishvamitra 
			is narrating the legend of Sagara to Rama and others. [1-40-30b, c]

			"When King Sagara passed away owing to the irrefutable virtue of Time, 
			the ministers and subjects of that kingdom are predisposed towards the 
			highly honourable Amshuman to become their king and they enthroned him 
			accordingly." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration about the predecessors 
			of Rama. [1-42-1]

			"He that Amshuman turned out to be a very great king, and oh, Rama of 
			Raghu's delight, he begot a marvellous son who is renowned as Dileepa. 
			[1-42-2]

			Assigning the kingdom to Dileepa, oh, Rama of Raghu's dynasty, Amshuman 
			undertook very stern ascesis on a pleasant peak of Himalayas desiring 
			the descent of River Ganga to earth. [1-42-3]

			On practising ascesis in ascetic-woods for thirty-two thousand years 
			that highly renowned king Amshuman achieved heaven as he acquired only 
			the wealth of practising the ascesis. [1-42-4]

			The great resplendent Dileepa on hearing the elimination of his grandfathers, 
			the sixty thousand sons of Sagara at the hand of sage Kapila, and with 
			a mind that is marred by the plight of his father Amshuman in absolving 
			the souls of Sagara's sons, he that Dileepa could not arrive at any 
			decision concerning the descent of Ganga. [1-42-5]

			Dileepa became worried as to how River Ganga is to be alighted onto 
			earth from heaven, how water-oblations are to be offered for the souls 
			of Sagara's sons, and how to cross them, the souls, over this mortal 
			world. [1-42-6]

			To him who is self-mortified and who is always thinking righteously 
			about the alight of Ganga onto earth, to such a Dileepa a most-virtuous 
			son is born who is renowned by his name Bhageeratha. [1-42-7]

			That great-resplendent king Dileepa on his part performed numerous 
			Vedic-rituals, and he ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years - 
			to the delight of each of his subjects, but could not find a way to 
			fetch Ganga. [1-42-8]

			Oh, tigerly-man Rama, that king Dileepa by not attaining any choice 
			towards the uplifting the souls of his grandparents to heaven by bringing 
			Ganga to earth, he took to illness, and he attained the ultimate virtue 
			of Time, namely the demise. [1-42-9]

			That best one among men, namely king Dileepa, on anointing his son 
			Bhageeratha in the kingdom went to the abode of Indra, namely the heaven, 
			only by his self-acquired merits of deeds. [1-42-10]

			Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, but on his part that self-righteous 
			and kingly-sage Bhageeratha is childless, and that great king longed-for 
			offspring. [1-42-11]

			Interested in the alighting of River Ganga on earth, oh, Rama, the 
			descendent of Raghu, king Bhageeratha delegated his kingdom to the custody 
			of his ministers and people and firmed up himself in sustained asceticism 
			on Mt. Gokarna in Himalayas, and he practise ascesis standing amid five-fires, 
			upraising his hands, with a monthly sustenance and with his sense conquered. 
			[1-42-12, 13a]

			Thousands of years have rolled by while Bhageeratha stood practising 
			his severe ascesis, oh, dextrous Rama, and then the lord and master 
			of all beings, namely god Brahma, is well pleased with that great-souled 
			king's ascesis. [1-42-13b, 14]

			Forefather Brahma then arrived along with assemblages of gods, and 
			spoke this way to the great-souled Bhageeratha who is deep in the practise 
			of ascesis. [1-42-15]

		  Oh, great king Bhageeratha, oh, lord of the people, I am delighted 
			with the perfectly conducted ascesis of yours, hence oh, truly committed 
			one, you may beseech for a boon. [1-42-16]

			That great resplendent and highly fortunate king Bhageeratha then remaining 
			with suppliantly adjoined palm fold spoke to him who is the Forefather 
			of all worlds, namely Brahma. [1-42-17]

			Oh, god, if you are satisfied with my ascesis, and if there is any 
			fruition to the ascesis of mine, let all the sons of Sagara get water 
			oblations through me. [1-42-18]

			While the ashes of these great souls are drenched with the waters 
			of Ganga, let all of those great-grandfathers of mine depart to heaven, 
			eternally. [1-42-19]

			Oh, god, I indeed pray for offspring in our Ikshvaku dynasty, let 
			not our dynasty dwindle as I am issueless, and oh, god, let this be 
			the other boon to me. [1-42-20]

			The Forefather of all the worlds, Brahma, then replied the king who 
			has spoken in that way, in an auspicious tongue that is sweet-sounding 
			and sweetly worded, as well. [1-42-21]

			Oh, top-speeded chariot-rider Bhageeratha, this aspiration of yours 
			is sublime, and oh, the furtherer of Ikshvaku dynasty, so be it, let 
			safeness betide you. [1-42-22]

			This Ganga is the one with snow-broth, the elder daughter of Himavanta, 
			and oh, king Bhageeratha, god Shiva alone is capable to sustain her 
			force in the course of her alighting onto earth, and in fact, he is 
			to be commissioned for that purpose. [1-42-23]

			'Oh, king Bhageeratha, the earth cannot endure the downfall of Ganga 
			and to sustain Ganga, oh, king, indeed I do not behold none other than 
			the Trident-wielder, god Shiva.' Thus Brahma spoke to Bhageeratha. [1-42-24]

			"Speaking this way to the king Bhageeratha and informally greeting Ganga 
			also, that Creator of Worlds, Brahma, left for heaven along with all 
			the groups of gods and Wind-gods." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration 
			about the arrival of River Ganga to earth. [1-42-25]

			On sojourning the remaining night on the bank of river Sona along with 
			great-sages, Viswamitra spoke when that night is elapsing into a sunny 
			daybreak. [1-35-1]

			"Oh, Rama, night fared into a sunny morning, eastern day-spring is set 
			in, hence awake and arise, you be safe, ready yourself for further travel." 
			[1-35-2]

			On hearing the words of Sage Vishvamitra, Rama woke up and on completion 
			of morning time religious activities he readied himself for further 
			journey and indeed spoke this sentence to the sage. [1-35-3]

			"This River Sona is with auspicious waters and even adorned with dunes, 
			where it is so deep. Oh, Brahman, in which of the two ways, namely 
			by fordless waters or by fordable water with dunes, we have to cross 
			this river?" [1-35-4]

			When Rama spoke to him thus sage Vishvamitra replied, "I propose the 
			same route by which these great sages are going. [1-35-5]

			Thus spoken by that astute Sage Vishvamitra, the other great sages travelled 
			on, indeed beholding diverse forests and their environs. [1-35-6]

			On going a distance on their way, and after a lapse of half a day, then 
			they perceived the prominent one among rivers and the one adored by 
			sages, namely River Ganga. [1-35-7]

			On seeing River Ganga with her pious waters and adored by swans and 
			saarasa waterfowls, all the sages felt delighted together with both 
			of the Raghava-s, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [1-35-8]

			Then they sojourned on the riverbank of Ganga, and next on taking bath 
			in Ganga they have customarily offered that river's water as oblations 
			to their manes. After that, on enkindling the ritual-fire they have 
			also offered fire-oblations into it for gods. Later, dining on their 
			part of those ambrosian oblations with which they have oblated the fire, 
			those sages perched on the propitious banks of Ganga, surrounding the 
			great-souled Vishvamitra from all sides, to the contentment of their 
			heart in having performed religious chores on the riverbank of Ganga. 
			[1-35-9, 10, 11a]

			When sages are sitting at ease then even Rama and Lakshmana sat down 
			according to their admissibility and custom of sitting before their 
			teachers, and then Rama highly gladdened at heart has spoken to Vishvamitra. 
			[1-35-11]

			"Oh, godly sage, I wish to listen about Ganga, the river that has a 
			trinal course, and as to how she is reaching the husband of rivulets 
			and rivers, namely the ocean, on pervading all the three worlds." Thus 
			Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-35-12]

			Motivated by Rama's words the eminent-sage Vishvamitra commenced to 
			narrate about the emergence and that way even about the progression

			"The lordly mountain Himavan who is the greatest treasure trove of minerals, 
			Rama, also treasures up a pair of daughters who by their comeliness 
			are unequalled on earth. [1-35-14]

			"The slender-waisted and fascinating daughter of Mt. Meru, oh, Rama, 
			renowned by her name Mena, is the dear wife of Himavan and the mother 
			of those two daughters, indeed. [1-35-15]

			"This Ganga has emerged as an elder daughter to Himavan through Mena, 
			oh, Raghava, and that way a girl renowned by the name Uma has become 
			a second daughter to him. [1-35-16]

			"Later, all of the divinities intending to fulfil a divine purpose have

			to become a tri-way-cruising river. [1-35-17]

			"With a righteous thinking and hopeful of the welfare in triadic world,

			[1-35-18]

			"Those divinities who are the well-wishers of the well-being of tri-world

The Horse Ritual of Emperor Dasharatha is started on the banks of Sarayu River. The details 
of the arrangements for the participants, and visitors along with some aspects of the Vedic 
Ritual are narrated.

Then after completion of one year and on regaining the ritual horse, the Emperor Dasharatha 
commenced his Vedic Ritual on the northern banks of River Sarayu. [1-14-1]

Keeping Rishyasringa at the helm of affairs those eminent Brahmans commenced, <em>ashva-medha</em> 
, the Horse-ritual of that noble-souled Dasharatha. [1-14-2]

Those well-versed conductors of Vedic rituals called <em>ritviks</em> , have started to perform 
works relating to ritual as per canon and rules, and conducted them scripturally and customarily. 
[1-14-3]

On performing <em>pravargya</em> ritual as per scriptures, like that <em>upasada</em> ritual 
too, those Brahmans have customarily performed all of those other rituals incidental to the 
main one scripturally. [1-14-4]

Then all of those distinguished sages are contended with what they have performed by worshipping 
gods already summoned, they also conducted early morning <em>savana</em> ritual and its ancillaries 
as enjoined. [1-14-5]

The oblations addressed to Indra are well given as ordained, and the flawless king Dasharatha 
also crushed the Soma creeper to squeeze Soma juice, and thus the mid-day <em>savana</em> 
ritual has come to pass according to sequence. [1-14-6]

Like that those proficient Brahmans have also performed the third <em>savana</em> , ritual 
of that great-exalted soul Dasharatha according to the viewpoint of scriptures. [1-14-7]

Rishyasringa and other best scholars with their well lettered and intonated Vedic hymns have 
invoked Indra and other gods to that place. [1-14-8]

The <em>hotaa</em> -s, invocators, have welcomed the celestials for partaking oblations by 
singing <em>saama</em> Veda hymns sweetly and harmoniously, and on inviting them with Vedic 
hymns they have offered oblations to them. [1-14-9]

There is no unburnt oblation resulted in that fire-ritual nor even a small mishap slipped 
in the performance of ritual. Everything appeared canonically correct and hymn oriented. Indeed 
the ritual is performed in a secure way. [1-14-10]

In these days of ritual none found there to be weary or hungry, and there is no single unscholarly 
person, nor any Brahman without at least a hundred apprentices. [1-14-11]

Given anytime the Brahmans, servants, sages, and pilgrims are fed with food for their arrival 
at the place of boarding is unpredictable, and that arrival is dependent on their duties for 
Brahmans, and by their masters for servants, and for pilgrims that do not have a particular 
time of arrival or departure. [1-14-12]

Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, no satisfaction 
to complete the meal is attained for themselves, as the food served is that pleasant.

Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, there is no satisfaction 
to Emperor Dasharatha, for it appeared to be too meagre a serving and a lot more is to be 
served. [1-14-13]

"Food be given abundantly, clothing be given variously" are the directives, accordingly the 
king's men have distributed numerously there at the ritual place. [1-14-14]

Heaps of foodstuffs are also appearing there, many of them and mountain similar, which is 
made available customarily, day after day. [1-14-15]

To that ritual of that great-souled Dasharatha masses of men and women have arrived from different 
countries, and they are all well-pleased with the sumptuous food and drink supplied. [1-14-16]

"The eminent Brahmans have appreciated the food that is prepared by perfect cooking to be 
relishable, and it is heard as they said, "oh, Raghava, blessed are you for we are satisfied..." 
[1-14-17]

Well-decorated men have served food to Brahmans, while others who wore gem-studded and lustrous 
earrings have helped them. [1-14-18]

Those eminent Brahmans that are good debaters have debated many intellectual debates to defeat 
each other, during the gap-periods of ritual works. [1-14-19]

Day by day those expert Brahmans have performed all ritual works as encouraged by Vashishta, 
and others and as contained in scriptures. [1-14-20]

There is no scholar without the knowledge of the six branches of Vedas, none who is an unavowed 
scholar, none who heard learnt less scriptures, and none among the members of the ritual of 
that king Dasharatha is an inexpert in debating, thus all are scholarly Brahmans. [1-14-21]

When the time came to stake wooden ritual posts, six posts of bilwa wood, six posts of khadira 
wood, and further the same number of posts of parnina wood are staked. One post of sleshmaataka 
wood and two of devadaaru wood as stipulated are staked. Then the distance between each post 
is maintained at the length of extended arms. [1-14-22,23]

All of those the posts are made by the authorities on scriptures and ritual scholars, and 
they are gold-pleated and decorated for the purpose of elegance to that ritual. [1-14-24]

They are altogether twenty-one posts, each post is twenty-one cubits in height, and each is 
decoratively clothed with each cloth. [1-14-25]

Carpenters have carved all the posts well, and built them strongly with octahedral surfaces 
that are smoothened, and thereby they are implanted procedurally. [1-14-26]

Those posts draped in cloths and worshipped with flowers and perfumery are irradiant, and 
they shone forth like the constellation of Seven Sages in the sky. [1-14-27]

The bricks for Altar of Fire are well designed and made according to rules and standard measurements. 
The Brahmans who are experts in the architecture of laying Fire Altar, by calculating the 
ritual field with a one-ply rope and decide where and how the that shall be, the Altar of 
Fire is layered well with bricks in that ritual. [1-14-28]

That Altar of Fire of that King, the Lion, is layered by expert Brahmans in the shape of an 
eagle with golden wings, with its size being three folds bigger than the altars of other rituals, 
thus it has eighteen separators, and fire is laid on it. [1-14-29]

In that ritual animals, serpents and birds designated to such and such deities are readied 
according to the scriptural directives. [1-14-30]

The sages have arranged those animals that are to be there in animal sacrifices, like horse 
and other aquatic animals, in that ritual according to scriptures. [1-14-31]

Three hundred animals are tied to the ritual posts, along with the gemlike best ritual horse 
of that King Dasharatha. [1-14-32]

With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, 
and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. [1-14-33]

Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse 
that flew away like a bird. [1-14-34]

Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely <em>hotaa</em> <em>adhwaryu</em> and <em>udgaataa</em> 
have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and a concubine of the 
king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king. [1-14-35]

Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum 
[fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to 
bake as a food to the celestials. [1-14-36]

The king Dasharatha smelt the smell of smoke as per time and procedure to cleanse his own 
sin. [1-14-37]

Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally 
oblated all of them into fire. [1-14-38]

In other rituals the oblations will be offered into sacrificial fire with spoon-like sticks 
of plaksha tree, but in Horse-sacrifice ritual they are offered through the vetasa creeper, 
a rattan plant, cane. [1-14-39]

The Horse Ritual is to be performed for three days as laid down in <em>kalpasutra</em>-s, 
the rules governing such rituals, and by <em>braahmaNa</em>-s, the penultimate parts of Veda-s, 
and the one performed on the first day is called <em>chatuSToma</em> ritual. [1-14-40]

The ritual on the second day is called <em>ukthyam</em> , and the next one performed on third 
day is called <em>atiraatra</em>. These apart many of the preordained rituals are performed 
there in that ritual as envisaged in scriptures. [1-14-41]

The rituals called <em>jyothiSToma, aayuSi,</em> and <em>atiraatra</em> rituals are performed. 
And also rituals of great kind like <em>abhijit, vishwajit, aptoryaama</em> are performed. 
[1-14-42]

As the promoter of his own dynasty that king Dasharatha donated eastern side to <em>hotaa</em>, 
western to <em>adhvaryu</em>, and southern to <em>brahmaa</em>. And to <em>udgaataa</em> northern 
side is given in donation. These were the donations stipulated in that great ritual, <em>ashwamedha</em>, 
by the Self-Created Brahma from earlier times. [1-14-44,43]

On completing the ritual thus that best man Dasharatha justifiably donated those lands to 
the officiating priests, called ritwiks, to promote his dynasty. [1-14-45]

Thus on giving away the vast expanses of his kingdom he that glorious one born in Ikshvaku 
dynasty is gladdened, but all the officiating priests said to the king who by now is rid of 
his sins. [1-14-46]

"You alone are capable to protect the earth in its entirety, and there is no use for us with 
these lands, and we are not capable to rule it, either." Thus the priests are addressing the 
king. [1-14-47]

"We are always preoccupied with self-study and teaching of scriptures, oh, king, thus you 
may give us something else in barter, any modest thing. " [1-14-48]

"Let best gems, gold, or cows or anything else that is available you may give us, what is 
the use of these vast expanses to us." So said the scholars. [1-14-49]

The king Dasharatha, the lord of people, thus requested by the scholarly Vedic Brahmans gave 
them millions of cows, ten of ten million gold coins, and the silver four times thereof. [1-14-50, 
51a]

Then all those officiating priests collectively gave that wealth to sage Rishyasringa and 
to the enlightened sage Vashishta. [1-14-51b, 52a]

Then all of those Brahmans are well satisfied at heart and distributed among themselves the 
wealth passed on by Rishyasringa and Vashishta, and then they said, "We are highly gladdened." 
[1-14-52a, 53a]

Then to the other Brahmans who arrived there to see the ritual, King Dasharatha sincerly donated 
ten million gold coins. [1-14-53b, 54a]

That descendent of Raghava dynasty gave an excellent hand ornament to someone who is an impoverished 
Brahman and who is beseeching. [1-14-54a, 55a]

While those Brahmans are becoming happy then that king and the patron of Brahmans venerated 
them dutifully with his senses fluttering with happiness. [1-14-55b, 56a]

Then that benevolent and valiant King Dasharatha prostrated on ground venerating the Brahmans, 
and the Brahmans too chanted various blessing hymns on that prostrating king. [1-14-56b, 57a]

Then that king is gladdened at heart for the successful achievement of the completion of that 
excellent ritual that removes sin and that leads to heaven as well, and that which cannot 
be undertaken by many of the best kings. [1-14-57b, 58a]

Thereafter king Dasharatha said to sage Rishyasringa thus, "oh, sage with best vows, you alone 
are eligible to perform the ritual for the expansion of my dynasty." [1-14-58b, 59a]

That best Brahman Rishyasringa saying yes to the proposal, said this to king Dasharatha, "oh, 
king, there will be four sons to you that ennoble your dynasty. [1-14-59b, c]

On hearing the sweet words of Sage Rishyasringa, he that king of kings Dasharatha went into 
a state of ecstasy and venerating that great soul, Rishyasringa, again said this to him. [1-14-60]

King Dasharatha commences the <em>putrakaameSTi</em> ritual aiming to beget progeny, under 
the aegis of Sage Rishyasringa. The celestial beings gather to receive the oblations offered 
in the Horse Ritual conducted by King Dasharatha. They are perturbed at the atrocities of 
Ravana, and request Brahma to think for a way to eliminate Ravana. Vishnu arrives there and 
pacifies Brahma and other celestials with an assurance that he will incarnate as human to 
eliminate Ravana.

That intellectual sage and one proficient in Veda-s Rishyasringa contemplated for a while, 
and gaining indications as to which ritual is to be performed, then said the king. [1-15-1]

"I will procedurally conduct the ritual contained in the preamble of <em>atharva-veda</em> 
with procedural hymns, called &lt;&lt;em&gt;&gt;putra kaameSTi i.e., the ritual that bestows sons, for 
your benefit." [1-15-2]

Then that resplendent Sage Rishyasringa commenced that <em>putrakaameSTi</em> ritual, offering 
oblations into sacred fire with ritual acts meticulously contained in hymns. [1-15-3]

Then the deities along with celestial beings, siddha-s, i.e., the souls that obtained salvation, 
and also other esteemed sages who by now are the residents of Heavens have duteously assembled 
in the firmament to receive their part of the oblations. [1-15-4]

Those deities who procedurally assembled there in that congregation then spoke to Brahma, 
the creator of worlds. [1-15-5]

"Oh! God, the demon named Ravana is torturing all of us with his intrepidity, as you have 
blessed him, and we are unable to control him. [1-15-6]

"You have given boon to him appreciating his ascesis and oh, god, with high regard to that 
boon of yours we are tolerating all the cruel acts of Ravana from then onwards [1-15-7]

"That malevolent Ravana is tormenting all the three worlds, hating the functionary deities 
of cosmos, and always desires to assail Indra, the king of all the functionary deities of 
universe. [1-15-8]

"That invincible one is further self-conceited by the boons you have accorded, and he is overbearingly 
torturing the sages, celestial beings like yaksha-s, gandharva-s, asura-s, and like that even 
the Brahmans. [1-15-9]

"The Sun-god will not verily parch Ravana, the Air-god will not puff at his sides, and on 
seeing Ravana, the lord of the undulating waves, namely the ocean will not pulsate either. 
[1-15-10]

"Thereby, there is a great panic for all of us from that demon with an awesome look, hence 
oh, god, it will be apt of you to give a thought for his elimination. [1-15-11]

When all the deities spoke to Brahma thus, he thought for a while and then said "Aha! The 
idea to kill that evil-minded Ravana is discerned. [1-15-12]

"Ravana said while seeking boon that, 'I shall not be killed by gandharva-s, yaksha-s, or 
by gods, or by other demons...' and I also said 'so be it..." [1-15-13]

"That demon did not express about humans then with his disrespect to them, and evidently his 
death does not occur otherwise." So said Brahma to gods. [1-15-14]

On hearing Brahma explaining himself, then all those gods and great sages became adequately 
happy. [1-15-15]

In the meanwhile the great resplendent Vishnu, the Lord of the Universe, arrived there mounted 
on his Eagle-vehicle Garuda, handling conch-shell, disc, and mace in his three of four hands, 
clad in yellow-ochre robes, wearing golden bracelets, and while best gods eulogised him, and 
his arrival there is like the arrival of sun mounted on black cloud to accord the gratuitous 
gift called the rain. [1-15-16, 17]

Vishnu having met Brahma stood there contemplating, and then all of the gods on bowing down 
and offering prayers addressed Vishnu. [1-15-18]

"Oh! Vishnu, desiring prosperity in all the worlds we nominate you to become the son of the 
ruler and lord of Ayodhya, namely Dasharatha, who is a virtuous one, renowned one and one 
whose resplendence equals that of the sages, and oh, Vishnu, through the wives of such a king 
Dasharatha, who are in similitude with the <em>hrii</em>, the virtue, <em>shrii</em>, the 
affluence, and <em>kiirti</em>, the glory, you have a fourfold transformation and take birth 
as their son. [1-15-19, 20, 21a]

"Oh! Vishnu, on your taking birth as human through the wives of Dasharatha you eliminate Ravana 
in war, who has become exacerbating and thorny to all worlds, and who is otherwise not eliminable 
for gods. [1-15-21b, 22a]

"He that preposterous demon Ravana with his invigorated doggedness is torturing gods along 
with eminent saints, gandharva-s, and siddha-s. [1-15-22b, 23a]

"He that furious one with his insolence is knocking down sages from their celestial abodes, 
and like that he is knocking down the gandharva-s and apsara celestials too from the heavenly 
gardens Nandana, where they will be taking delight. [1-15-23b, 24a]

"We the celestial beings like siddha-s, gandharva-s, yaksha-s along with sages have actually 
come for his elimination, and thereby we seek shelter in you. [1-15-24b, 25a]

"Oh, enemy tormentor, oh, Vishnu, you are the ultimate recourse for all us in eliminating 
enemies of divinity, hence you make up your mind to take birth in human world." The gods appealed 
to Vishnu that way. [1-15-25b, 26a]

When the god of gods Vishnu, the supreme one among deities, one who is revered by all worlds 
is eulogised this way, then he spoke to all of those celestials that abide in the righteousness 
and that are in the assemblage, keeping the Forefather Brahma at their helm. [1-15-26a, 27]

"Get rid off the fear, let safety be upon you, on eliminating that cruel and evil-minded Ravana 
who became dreadful to deities and sages, along with his sons, grandsons, friends, cousins 
and relatives, ministers and forces too in war for your welfare, I will then reside in human 
world ruling this earth for eleven thousand years." Thus Vishnu assured the gods. [1-15-28, 
29, 30a]

On giving boon to all gods in that way the kind-hearted god Vishnu started to think about 
the instituting base for his birth in human world. [1-15-30b, 31a]

And then that lotus-petal-eyed one agreeing to manifest himself in fourfold way is predisposed 
towards Dasharatha to be his father. [1-15-31b, 32a]

Then all the groups of gods, sages, gandharva-s, with rudraa-s, and apsarasa-s, extolled Vishnu 
with prayers of divine exposition. [1-15-32b, c]

"Oh! Vishnu, he that fiery one who is renowned for evil acts and who is the hater of Indra, 
that Ravana is uprising furiously with his heightened arrogance, and he has become a thorn in the 
side of hermits hence he is a fright to sages, afor he tortures insubordinates to the the extent of 
loud wailing; hence we pray you to eliminate that Ravana." [1-15-33]

"On eliminating that furiously vainglorious Ravana with all his forces and with all his kinsmen 
neutralise the pandemonium created by him in all the worlds, and for a long time to come you 
get rid of your febrility, and you please return to your heavenly abode, namely your blameless 
and faultless Vaikuntha. [1-15-34]

Sumantra thus motivated by King Dasharatha, said these words to king "Oh! King, how and with 
which idea Sage Rishyasringa is brought by the ministers of Romapada, all that will be spoken... 
that may please be listened from me along with ministers... [1-10-1]

"The ministers along with clergyman have spoken this way to King Romapaada, "this is a non-harmful 
plan, well thought over by us..." [1-10-2]

"Rishyasringa is a forest-dweller absorbed in ascesis and self-study of Vedic scriptures, 
and he is not aware of women, or of worldly-matters or of even worldly-pleasures...[1-10-3]

"With much desired sense-pleasing objects that will be disquieting the minds of men, we wish 
bring him to the city... Let it be decided quickly... [1-10-4]

"Beautiful and well decorated courtesans will go there to bring him hither by tempting with 
many a feint, and let the courtesans be given ample gifts... [1-10-5]

"Hearing that the King replied the priest, "Let it be so..." and then the priests and ministers 
have carried out the plan that way... [1-10-6]

"On hearing that order of the king those best courtesans have entered that great forest, and 
they camped not very far from that hermitage, making all the trials for showing themselves 
off to a glance of that sage. [1-10-7]

"Always satisfied is sage Rishyasringa to be in hermitage, thus he never stirred out of that 
hermitage, and thus he has not seen any female, or a male, or even any other objects of pleasure, 
either of city or of countryside from the time of birth onwards... [1-10-8b, 9]

"Then at one time Rishyasringa casually arrived at that place, and has seen those comely females. 
[1-10-10]

"They the lustful women are amazingly attired and singing melodious tunes, all of them neared 
the sage's son and spoke these words... [1-10-11]

"Who you are? Why you move lonely in these deep and desolate forests, why you conduct yourself 
like this? Oh! Brahman, we are interested to know... please tell us..." [1-10-12]

"Those women are in most desirable form and hitherto he has not seen such forms in that forest, 
hence a kind of friendship spouted, with which he is inclined to detail about his father... 
[1-10-13]

"My father is Sage Vibhandaka and I am his true descent son. I am known as Rishyasringa, by 
my name and by an event on my birth, and thus renowned on earth..."

"Our hermitage is here only, oh, august ones, I wish to perform scripturally worship to you 
all verily there..." thus said the sage to the courtesans. [1-10-15]

"On hearing the words of sage's son, all those courtesans are verily inclined to see the threshold 
of that hermitage, then all the women went to hermitage. [1-10-16]

"On going there, then the Sage's son performed worship saying "Here is our hand-wash, here 
is our feet-wash, here are our tuber fruits, here are the juicy fruits of ours... " [1-10-17]

"All of them have received that kind of worship much enthusiastically, but dread at the arrival 
of the sage Vibhandaka, they quickly made-up their mind to make away from there. [1-10-18]

" 'Take these important fruits of ours, oh, Brahman, you be safe, oh, holy one... eat them 
before long....' Said courtesans to Rishyasringa.] [1-10-19]

"Then all of the courtesans have embraced him and all of them with a kind of mirthfulness 
in the offing, presented sweet-balls and other varieties of best sweetmeats to him. [1-10-20]

"Having relished the sweets, that resplendent sage supposed them to be fruits only, for he 
did not taste sweets earlier, as he is always forest-bound. [1-10-21]

"Taking leave of the Sage Rishyasringa on pretence that they also have to perform devotional 
duties, they the courtesans departed from there on the pretext of their daily worship, while 
they actually feared for the arrival of Rishyasringa's father who may hurl curses on his arrival... 
[1-10-22]

"After the departure of all them the courtesans, that Brahman Rishyasringa, the grandson of 
Sage Kaashyapa, is disturbed at heart and even behaved sadly... [1-10-23]

"Then on the next day Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandaka and the prosperous sage with ascetic 
power has arrived at that place where he saw well-decorated and delightful courtesans recollecting 
in mind repetitively about them alone. [1-10-24, 25a]

" Then on seeing the arrival of that Brahman, the courtesans felt happy at heart, and all 
of those courtesans on surrounding him said, "oh, gentle one, welcome to the threshold of 
our hermitage... [1-10-25b, 26]

"There are excellent tuber fruits and fruits and there will be a very distinctive hospitality... 
definitely indeed..." So said the courtesans.[1-10-27]

"On hearing the heart-pleasing words of all those courtesans, Rishyasringa made up his mind 
to go over there, and then those women took him away [to their place in Anga Kingdom.] [1-10-28]

"While that great soul ad Brahman Rishyasringa while being brought into Anga Kingdom, then 
the Rain-god quickly showered rain in Anga kingdom to the delight of the world. [1-10-29]

"The king Romapada personally proceeded towards that Brahman Rishyasring who is now 
entering Anga kingdom along with rains, made prostratiion before him, offered water 
customarily with dedication, and then the king Romapada besought beneficence 
of the best sage Rishyasringa to save him and his kingdom from the fury of his father Sage Vibhandaka, 
if sage Vibhandaka were to know about this pursuit of bringing Rishyasringa to Anga 
country, at a later time ... [1-10-30, 31]

"On entering the palace princess Shanta is given to Rishyasringa in customary marriage, and 
then that King Romapada obtained rejoice with a peaceful mind. [1-10-32]

" Thus that great fulgent Rishyasringa lived in Anga kingdom along with his wife Shanta, and 
with all his desires fulfilled and also well worshipped" [Thus Sumantra said the legend of 
Rishyasringa to King Dasharatha.] [1-10-33]

Later when the Omnipresent Narayana is thus nominated by best gods, and though he knows the 
outcome, he gently spoke these words to gods in this way. [1-16-1]

"What is the idea to eliminate that demon's chief Ravana, oh, gods, adopting which strategy 
I will have to eliminate that thorn in the side of sages?" Thus Vishnu asked the gods. [1-16-2]

Asked thus all the gods said to that sempiternal Vishnu, "on assuming a human form, eliminate 
Ravana in a war." [1-16-3]

"Oh, destroyer of enemies, he that Ravana undertook a vehement ascesis for a long period, 
thereby the creator of worlds and the first born one Brahma, felt gladsome of his ascesis. 
[1-16-4]

"Satisfied with his ascesis Brahma gave boon to that demon that he shall have no fear for 
his life from many kinds of beings, excepting humans, because that demon indeed slighted humans 
earlier at the time of bestowing boon. [1-16-5, 6a]

"Thus, on getting boon from the Forefather Brahma he has become arrogant and torturing the 
three worlds, and he is even abducting women. As such, oh, enemy destroyer Vishnu, his elimination 
is envisaged through humans alone." So said gods to Vishnu. [1-16-6b, 7]

On hearing that speech of gods said that way, he that kind-hearted Vishnu then chose Dasharatha 
as his father in human world. [1-16-8]

During that time the great resplendent king and an enemy subduer Dasharatha is performing
<font color="#B3003A">putrakaameSTi</font> ritual, desiring progeny as he is sonless. [1-16-9]

On taking a decision Vishnu took leave of Forefather Brahma, and vanished while he is still 
being extolled by gods and sages. [1-16-10]

Then, from Fire of Altar Dasharatha's ritual there emerged a greatly vigorous and energetic 
Divine Being with an unparalleled resplendence, called <font color="#B3003A">yajna-puruSa</font>. 
[1-16-11]

He is clad in black and red garments and his face is red and his voice resembled the drumbeat. 
His moustache and hairdo are soft like that of a lion's mane. [1-16-12]

And he is endowed with auspicious features and decorated with divine ornaments, in height 
he is like a mountain peak, and in valiance he is like an imperious tiger. [1-16-13]

That great ritual being personally brought a big golden vessel carrying it with both of his 
hands as if he would personally handle his own wife, which vessel is made from the molten 
gold and covered with a silver lid, and which appeared to be crafted out of a divine illusion, 
since it is dazzling like sun and glowing like the tongues of flame, and that vessel is full 
with the divine dessert. [1-16-14, 15]

That divine person on observing king Dasharatha said these words "oh, king, you may know me 
as the being sent by Prajapati." [1-16-16]

There after, king Dasharatha greeted that divine being with palms adjoining and said in reply, 
"oh, god, welcome to you, and what shall I do for you?" [1-16-17]

Then again, that divine being sent by Prajapati said these words, "oh, king, now you have 
obtained this dessert in golden vessel as you have propitiated gods. [1-16-18]

"Oh, tigerly king, take this dessert prepared by divinities, this is a blessed dessert that 
enriches progeny and health. [1-16-19]

"Oh, king, let this be consumed" saying so he further said, "for which purpose you have performed 
this ritual that childbearing will be fructified in your wives by bearing sons, hence give 
this among your eligible wives." So said the divine being to Dasharatha. [1-16-20]

Agreeing to that the king wholeheartedly took that god-given golden vessel full with divine 
food. [1-16-21]

With high ecstasy Dasharatha revered that Ritual Being, the <font color="#B3003A">Prajaapati- 
PuruSha</font> or <font color="#B3003A">yaj~na-puruSha</font> , an astonishing and delightful 
being in his appearance, and performed circumambulations around him. [1-16-22]

On obtaining that dessert prepared by gods then Dasharatha is highly gladdened like a pauper 
obtaining unforeseen wealth. [1-16-23]

On completing his work of giving the golden vessel with dessert then that divine being who 
is astonishing by his form and highly glowing by his physique, disappeared then and there 
itself. [1-16-24]

Lit up with beams of happiness Dasharatha's palace chambers shone forth like the autumnal 
sky brightened with moonbeams. [1-16-25]

Then Dasharatha on entering palace chambers spoke this to queen Kausalya, "Receive this dessert 
to beget your son." [1-16-26]

The king then gave half of the dessert to queen Kausalya, and he gave half of the half, i.e., 
one fourth to queen Sumitra. And to Kaikeyi he gave half of the remaining half, i.e., one 
eight of the dessert, with a desire to beget sons. Then thinking for a while gave the remaining, 
i.e., one-eighth portion again to queen Sumitra. Thus, the king distributed the dessert to 
his wives differently. [1-16-27, 28, 29]

On getting the dessert all of those best ladies of the king, whose hearts are exuberant with 
happiness, deemed it as a reward. [1-16-30]

Then on consuming dessert those best ladies of the king whose resplendence then vied with 
that Fire and Sun became pregnant after some time. [1-16-31]

Then on seeing his queens with confirmed pregnancies Dasharatha regained his lost heart for 
sons, and he is gladdened like Vishnu, who will always be gladsome when worshipped by gods, 
namely Indra and others, as well as by the assemblages of great souls, sages. [1-16-32]

			Describing that legend of Kaartikeya to Rama, the descendent of Kaushi,

			melodiously to Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha. [1-38-1]

			"Once there was a valiant and virtue-souled king of Ayodhya named Sagara,

			<em>"Reaching the Himalayan Mountains along with his two wives that

			"On completion of a hundred years of ascesis, and when the Sage Bhrugu 
			is worshipped with asceticism, that sage who is a prominent one among

			<em>" 'Oh, merited one, you will achieve very admirable progeny, and

			" 'One of your wives will mother a son who enriches your dynasty, oh,

			Highly gladdened are the daughters of kings of Vidarbha and Aristanemi, 
			i.e., the queens of Sagara, and on making palm-fold in supplication

			" 'Which of us will carry one son, oh, Brahma-sage, and which of us 
			begets numerous sons, we two wish to listen about that, oh, Brahman, 
			let your word betide truth.' Thus, the queens of Sagara spoke to the 
			sage. [1-38-10]

			On listening their words the Sage Bhrigu spoke in a glorious tone, 'let 
			your freewill be brought to bear this issue'. [1-38-11]

			 'Whether one wants one son who enriches dynasty, or whether numerous 
			sons who will be highly energetic, highly renowned, and highly enthusiastic. 
			Who wants which boon from either of them?' Thus, the Sage gave them 
			the option. [1-38-12]

			"On listening the words of the sage, oh, Rama, oh, delighter of Raghu's 
			dynasty, the first queen Keshini has chosen one son who enriches the 
			dynasty in the presence of King Sagara. [1-38-13]]

			"Sumati, the sister of mighty-winged Garuda and the second queen of 
			Sagara has then chosen sixty thousand sons with great enthusiasm and 
			high reputation. [1-38-14]

			"On performing circumambulations to the Sage Bhrigu along with wives, 
			oh, Raghu's scion, also on reverencing him head-bent, the king Sagara 
			proceeded to his own city. [1-38-15]

			When the time rolled by then the elder wife Keshini gave birth to the 
			son of Sagara who is reputed by the name Asamanja. [1-38-16]

			But the second queen Sumati on part, oh, tigerly-man Rama, verily 
			delivered a round and long egg which is like a single gourd, and on 
			breaking it up sixty thousand sons are issued forth from that cucumber 
			like egg. [1-38-17]

			The childminders brought up those siblings in vessels filled with ghee,

			After a long time the sixty thousand sons of king Sagara have become

			But, oh, best one among men, oh, Rama, the elder son of the king Sagara, 
			namely Asamanja, always used to grab and hurl children into the waters 
			of River Sarayu, and on seeing the drowning children he used to enjoy 
			with laughter. [1-38-20, 21a]

			This way, when that son Asamanja is with sinister activity, a torturer 
			of goodmen, and delighter in the undesirable activities towards citizens, 
			his father king Sagara expatriated him from the city. [1-38-21b, 22a]

			But Asamanja's son is a valorous one, who by name is Anshuman, and who 
			is an acceptable one for all people and who fondly converses with all. 
			[1-38 -22b, 23a]

			"Oh, best one among men, Rama, then after along time a decided thought

			That king Sagara who is an expert in Vedic-procedures has then taken

 When that night is elapsing into the wee hours of next day, then the eminent-saint
  Vishvamitra on asking for the leave of absence from those kings, Dasharatha and Janaka, and from
  both Rama and Lakshmana, he set out to northern mountains, namely Himalayas. [1-74-1]

 When Vishvamitra departed that ruler to the delight of people, namely Dasharatha,
  on asking leave of absence with king Janaka who outvies bodily affairs, promptly set forth for
  the city of Ayodhya. [1-74-2]

 Then that king Janaka of Mithila, the one from Videha lineage, gave innumerable
  patrimonial riches. He has also given umpteen number of cows, millions of excellent shawls and
  silk dresses, and elephants, horses, chariots, foot soldiers, besides hundreds of highly
  decorated girls, divine in their mien, as unexcelled chambermaids and handmaidens to the brides.
  [1-74-3, 4, 5a]

 King Janaka gave beau idéal bridal riches in gold, silver, pearls and corals even,
  for he is very highly gladdened as Seetha's marriage came true. [1-74-5b, 6a]

 Having given many kinds of bridal gifts and having accompanied his daughters for a
  distance, then having received a bid adieu from Dasharatha, that sovereign of Mithila, Janaka,
  re-entered is own palace in Mithila. [1-74-6, 7a]

 Even the king Dasharatha, the sovereign of Ayodhya proceeded with his noble-souled
  sons, keeping all the sages in the fore, while his forces followed him. [1-74-7b, 8a]

 But while going with the assemblages of sages and with young Raghava-s, namely
  Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, the sky-bound birds started to screech with startling voice
  from all around facing that tigerly-man Dasharatha. [1-74-8b, 9a]

 Also thus, all of the earth bound animals are going his leftward, and on seeing
  this, albeit he is a tigerly king he is perplexed, and particularly asked Vashishta. [1-74-9b,
  10a]

 "Unpropitious is the starling voicing of birds, whereby my heart is throbbing
  down... and propitious is the leftward going of the animals, thereby my heart is throbbing up...
  why so?" [1-74-10b, 11a]

 On hearing all that is said by king Dasharatha, the instinctual sage Vashishta
  said this sentence in a soothing voice, "I will tell apart the result of these auguries...
  [1-74-11b, 12a]

 "The shrieks voiced by the birds are foretokening the forthcoming providential and
  perilous trepidation, but the behaviour of these animals is betokening it as mitigable... hence,
  let this consternation be forsaken... [1-74-12b, 13a]

 While they are discussing among themselves, a whirlwind started to whirligig
  there, as though to shake the earth and shatter all gigantic trees. [1-74-13b, 14a]

 Murkiness enshrouded the sun, thus everyone is unaware of quarters, a sandstorm
  enwrapped that army, by which it has become as though ensorcelled. [1-74-14b, 15a]

 Then Vashishta and the other sages, the king Dasharatha along with his sons
  remained there with animation, and everything and every other one available there has become
  inanimate. [1-74-15b, 16a]

 In that catastrophic darkness, that sand-muffled military of king Dasharatha has
  seen the son of Sage Jamadagni, namely Bhaargava Rama, the subjugator of kings of kings. He
  appeared calamitous in his look by wearing tufty matted and unruly head-hair, an unassailable one
  like Mt. Kailash, an unbearable one like the Epoch-End-Fire, irradiant with his own radiance,
  hence imperceivable for commoners, and such as he is, he clinched an axe on his right shoulder
  and clasped a bow in his left hand, that in simile is like a congeries of electroluminescence,
  and handling an arrow which is as if ready to electrocute, and he vied in his overall look with
  the devastator of triple cities, namely God Shiva. [1-74-16b, 17, 18, 19]

 On seeing him who is perilous in his propensity and flaming like the Ritual-fire,
  Vashishta and the other prominent Brahman-s who are the practisers of meditation and
  fire-oblations have come together and started to susurrate, up and down. [1-74-20, 21a]

 "Will he eradicate the race of Kshatriya-s even now as he was once envenomed by
  the murder of his father, or what... abated is his anger and alleviated is his frenzy previously
  when he eliminated Kshatriya-s... but is he really intending to eliminate Kshatriya-s once again,
  or what?" Thus, those Brahmans talked among themselves. [1-74-21b, 22]

 After their susurrus the sages have approached him, who in his very look is like a
  visitation, with oblational water and addressed him with benign words of greeting like, "oh,
  Rama, oh, Bhaargava Rama..." [1-74-23]

 On receiving the deference paid by the sage Vashishta, that inexorable Rama of
  Jamadagni started to talk to Rama of Dasharatha. [1-74-24]

When sage Vashishta said that way, Janaka reverentially made palm fold and said this in reply, "oh, sage, let safeness betide 
you all... now, it will be apt of you all to listen to our distinguished lineage..." [1-71-1]

"Oh, eminent sage Vashishta, he who is born in a particular noble gens has to inform about his parentage in its entirety, 
especially when he offers a bride... thereby oh, great sage, let all be informed of about our lineage..." [1-71-2]

Once there was an emperor Nimi, who was renowned in the triad of worlds by his own accomplishments, and who was uniquely 
seraphic-souled and a best one among all stalwart emperors... [1-71-3]

And his son was named as Mithi, and Janaka was Mithi's son... the first one to be designated as Janaka... and even from 
that Janaka it is Udaavasu who took birth... [1-71-4]

From Udaavasu it is noble souled Nandivardhana took birth, and Nandivardhana's son is named as Suketu, by his name... [1-71-5]

From Suketu the highly powerful and virtue-souled Devaraata is born, and from that kingly sage Devaraata, it is Brihadratha 
who took birth, thus we have heard... [1-71-6]

From Brihadratha it is the highly braving, courageous and valiant Mahaaviira has come, and the bold and truth-valiant Sudhriti 
from Mahaaviira... [1-71-7]

Form Sudhriti, the right-minded and highly generous Dhristaketu took birth, and from the kingly sage Dhristaketu it is 
highly renowned Haryashva is the son... [1-71-8]

Haryashva's son is Maru, and Maru's, son is Pratiindhaka, and the son of Pratiindhaka's is noble-souled king Kiirtiratha... 
[1-71-9]

The son of Kiirtiratha is remembered as Devamiidha, and the son of Devamiidha is Vibudha, and Vibudha's son is Mahiidraka... 
[1-71-10]

Mahiidraka's son is the great mighty king Kiirtiraata, and the son born to sagely king Kiirtiraata is Mahaaroma... [1-71-11]

From Mahaaroma it is the virtue-souled Swarnaroma, and from kingly sage Swarnaroma it is Hrasvaroma... [1-71-12]

Two sons are born to that knower of virtue and noble souled Hrasvaroma, I am the elder, and my younger brother is this 
brave Kushadhvaja... [1-71-13]

He that king and father of ours, Hrasvaroma, anointing me in kingdom as I am the elder, and vesting the duty of looking 
after Kushadhvaja in me, he departed to forests... [1-71-14]

On the departure of our aged father to heaven, I am looking after this godlike Kushadhvaja with brotherliness and lugging 
around the burden of this kingship... [1-71-15]

Then after sometime, a valorous king named Sudhanva came beleaguering Mithila, from his city Saamkaasha... [1-71-16]

'The unexcelled bow of Shiva shall be given to me, along with the lotus-eyed virgin, Seetha...' thus he started to urge 
me... [1-71-17]

"Oh, Brahma sage Vashishta, for the reason of my non-bestowal of bow or bride he warred with me, and when he affronted me 
in that war I have put that Sudhanva to the sword..." [1-71-18]

Oh, best sage Vashishta, on eliminating king Sudhanva, I have anointed my valiant brother Kushadhvaja in the kingdom of 
Saamkaasha... [1-71-19]

Oh, best saint Vashishta, this is that younger brother of mine, and I am the elder. Oh, eminent-saint, I am bestowing those 
brides with a highly gladdened heart... Seetha for Rama, and Urmila for Lakshmana, let there be felicity for all... [1-71-20, 
21a]

My daughter Seetha is the bounty for bravery and in simile she is the daughter of the divine Providence, and thus the second 
one Urmila too... oh, eminent-saint, with a highly gladdened heart I reiterate thrice while I bestow those brides, there 
is no doubt about it... [1-71-21b, 22a]

Oh, king Dasharatha, let the preceding ritual of <font color="#B3003A">samaavartana</font>, be undertaken, and let manes 
be propitiated by the ritual, <font color="#B3003A">naandi-shraadha</font>, and afterwards you make happen the wedding celebrations 
... thus, all will be blest... [1-71-22b, 23]

Oh, great dextrous Dasharatha, the star ruling today is <font color="#B3003A">magha</font>, isn't it... oh, lord, on the 
third from now, say day after tomorrow, when the star <font color="#B3003A">phaalguNi</font> comes, in its later part, namely
<font color="#B3003A">uttara-phalugNi</font>, you may make happen this wedding, and the bounties like
<font color="#B3003A">go-bhuu-tila-hiraNyaadi</font> i.e., ' cows, lands, grains, gold etc., that ensue the wellbeing 
of Rama and Lakshmana, may be accorded to the eligible generously... [1-71-24]

 On listening to the words of Janaka, the eminent-saint Vishvamitra indeed said to
  the king Janaka thus as, "let the bow be displayed to Rama..." [1-67-1]

 Then king Janaka indeed ordered his ministers, "bring the divine bow which is
  decorated with sandalwood paste and garlands... [1-67-2]

 Thus clearly instructed by Janaka those high souled ministers have gone out from
  there and entered the palace-chambers, and they came out with an eight-wheeled coffer in which
  the bow of Shiva is ensconced, and those ministers got it tugged by five thousand tall men of
  illimitable energy who somehow tugged it very difficultly, and thus the ministers have re-entered
  there keeping that bow afore of them. [1-67-3, 4]

 On fetching that iron coffer wherein that bow is there, those ministers of the
  king have reported to their godlike King Janaka. [1-67-5]

 Oh king and sovereign of Mithila, here is the select bow that is reverenced by
  all kings, oh, best king, which you wished to be evincible to the boys, to evince their
  capabilities... [1-67-6]

 On listening the announcement of his ministers the king spoke to the noble souled
  Vishvamitra and to both Rama and Lakshmana too duly making palm-fold. [1-67-7]

 Here is that exquisite bow, oh, Brahman, which is held as a time-honoured bow by
  the lineage of Janaka kings, and with which even the highly forceful kings are rendered
  inefficient to take aim with it, previously... [1-67-8]

 None in all the assemblages of gods, inclusive of demigods, demons, gandharva-s,
  yaksha-s, kinnaraa-s, or reptilian demigods, is capable enough to take aim with this bow and all
  are rendered incapable... and then, in brandishing this bow for a proper grip, or in bracing its
  bowstring to the other end, or in twitching the bowstring for its tautness, or in placing the
  arrow on bowstring at a proper place for a proper stretchability, or even in taking a good aim
  with it... what will be that capability of one from among humans... [1-1-9, 10]

 "Oh, eminent-saint, such as it is, this nonpareil bow among all bows is brought
  in, and oh, highly fortunate sage Vishvamitra, let this be displayed to those two princes..."
  Thus Janaka said to Vishvamitra. [1-67-11]

 Vishvamitra on listening the sentence of Janaka along with Rama, on his part said
  to Raghava, "oh, boy Rama... you may see the bow..." [1-67-12]

 Upon the word of the great sage Vishvamitra, Rama on unclosing the lid of that
  strongbox, wherein that bow is ensconced, saw the bow and said. [1-67-13]

 Now I wish to get the feel of this supreme bow, oh, Brahman, and I shall try to
  brandish it, or even try to take aim with it... [1-67-14]

 "All Right!" said the saint and king to Rama in chorus, and Rama upon the word of
  the sage grasping it at the middle handgrip playfully grabbed the bow. [1-67-15]

 While many thousands of men are witnessing that right-minded Rama the legatee of
  Raghu stringed the bow effortlessly. [1-67-16]

 Further, that dextrous one has stringed that bow with bowstring and started to
  stretch it up to his ear to examine its tautness, but that glorious one who is foremost among
  men, Rama, broke that bow medially. [1-67-17]

 Then there bechanced an explosive explosion when the bow is broken, like the
  explosiveness of down plunging thunder, and the earth is tremulously tremulous, as it happens
  when a mountain is exploding. [1-67-18]

 Bewildered by that raucous caused by the breakage of bow, all the people swooned,
  except for that eminent-saint Vishvamitra, king Janaka, and those two Raghava-s, namely Rama and
  Lakshmana. [1-67-19]

 While the people are being reaccustomed after their undergoing the shock, at that
  moment that sententious king Janaka, whose discomfiture has completely departed by now has said
  this to the eminent-saint Vishvamitra with a reverent palm-fold. [1-67-20]

 Oh, godly sage, the gallantry of Dasharatha's Rama is evidently seen... and the
  whys of this boy and wherefores of his stringing that massive bow are unimaginable to me! More
  so, humans lifting it! How so? This is an unhoped-for incident for me, besides, breaking it! This
  a is highly wondrous experience for me... [1-67-21]

 My daughter Seetha on getting Dasharatha's Rama as her husband, she will bring
  celebrity to the lineage of Janaka-s... [1-67-22]

 Oh, Kaushika, my commitment that she is the bounty of bravery has also come
  true... and my daughter Seetha who is nurtured well than my own lives is a worthy bride for
  Rama... [1-67-23]

 Should you give consent, oh, Brahman, my ministers will be hastened to speedily
  go to Ayodhya in chariots, oh, Kaushika, let safeness betide you, and one and all by this
  matrimony... [1-67-24]

 With their observant submissions those ministers will narrate in detail about the
  sincere endowment of Seetha as bravery's bounty to Rama, and they will lead king Dasharatha into
  my city that observantly... [1-67-25]

 "Those ministers will also tell the king Dasharatha that both the Kakutstha-s,
  Rama and Lakshmana, are under the aegis of saint Vishvamitra, and thus gladdening that king they
  will expeditiously usher in king Dasharatha for marriage..." So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.
  [1-67-26]

 Vishvamitra said, "so be it," and then that right-minded king Janaka on consulting
  with his ministers started to send his ministers, plenipotentiaries, to Ayodhya to inform
  Dasharatha in detail as to what has happened, and likewise to bring him to Mithila. [1-67-27]

			On listening the narration of Vishvamitra, Rama, the delighter of Raghu's 
			dynasty is highly rejoiced, and at the end of the episode he spoke to 
			sage whose glow is fire like. [1-39-1]

			I am interested to listen this episode exhaustively, oh, Brahman, let 
			good betide you, how my ancestor Sagara had completed the Vedic-ritual, 
			really. [1-39-2]

			On listening the words of Rama that are inclusive of his inquisitiveness, 
			Sage Vishvamitra smilingly spoke to that descendent of Kakutstha, "oh, 
			Rama, let the episode of the great-souled Sagara be listened vividly." 
			Vishvamitra thus commenced to narrate that episode. [1-39-3, 4a]

			The father-in-law of god Shankara who is well-known by the name of 
			Himavan sets eyes on Mt. Vindhya, which stands as loftily as Himalayas, 
			and those two mountains peer at each other. [1-39-4b, 5a]

			Oh, best one among men, Rama, that Vedic-ritual of Sagara started 
			in between those two mountains, namely Himalayas and Vindhya ranges, 
			and oh, tigerly-man Rama, that area is renowned for Vedic-rituals, isn't 
			it! [1-39-5b, 6a]

			Oh, dear sire Rama, the grandson of Sagara and the son of exiled Asamanja 
			is Amshuman, oh, descendant of Kakutstha, which Anshuman's bow will 
			be unfaltering and who is a top-speeded chariot-rider, and he has escorted 
			ritual-horse released. [1-39-6b, 7a]

			And on the day of a sacred function called <font color="#B3003A">ukthyam</font> 
			, Indra assumed the form of a demon and stole the ritual horse of the 
			chief of the ritual, namely Sagara. [1-39-7b, 8a]

			While that ritual-horse of the great-souled Sagara is stolen, all the 
			congregations of the Ritviks, the religious-teachers, then spoke to 
			the chief propitiator, namely Sagara. [1-39-8b, 9a]

			'Oh, Sagara,the descendent of Kakutstha, at this auspicious time the 
			ritual horse is hastily diverted, you kill him who stole the horse, 
			and let that horse be fetched'. [1-39-9b, 10a]

			'This hindrance in Vedic-ritual will become inauspicious for all of 
			us, thereby, oh, king, action may be taken as to how there can be no 
			fault in proceedings of the ritual.' The religious-teachers of Sagara 
			have advised him in this way. [1-39-10b, 11a]

			On hearing the words of religious-teachers that king Sagara indeed 
			spoke this much to his sixty thousand sons in that religious-council. 
			[1-39-11b, 12a]

			'Oh, sons, I do not envisage any way in for demons into this ritual, 
			since oh, best ones among men, holy-sanctifiers who themselves are sanctified 
			by the Vedic-hymns are conducting this glorious Vedic-ritual, isn't 
			it. [1-39-12b, 13a]

			'Oh, sons, you may therefore proceed to search for the horse and its 
			thief on entire earth as far as it is garlanded by the ocean, and safety 
			betides you all. [1-39-13]

			'Oh, sons, let each prince advance searching one square yojana of 
			earth, by my order you dig up the earth until the appearance of the 
			horse, while searching for the stealer of that horse. [1-39-14b, 15]

			'As for myself, I will stay here only along with my grandson, namely 
			Amshuman, and with the congregation of religious-teachers till the horse 
			appears, as I am under vow of the ritual.' Thus Sagara instructed to 
			his sixty thousand sons and stayed back at the ritual place. [1-39-16]

			Animated by their father's words those great-mighty princes enthusiastically 
			proceeded onto earth's surface in the preliminary round of search. [1-39-1]

			But, oh, tigerly-man Rama, on going round the earth in its entirety 
			those great-mighty princes did not find that horse, then as said by 
			their father they mapped the earth to a unit of one square yojana for 
			each of them, and each of them hollowed out each and every area on the 
			surface of earth with their arms that have the touch of the diamonds. 
			[1-39-18]

			Mother Earth bewailed while she is ruptured with spears also that are 
			similar to thunderbolts, besides with very gruelling ploughs. [1-39-19]

			Oh, Raghava, there emerged an unbearable rumpus from the serpents, 
			asura-s, demons, and other beings living underneath the surface of earth, 
			while they are killed during hollowing the earth. [1-39-20]

			Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu's dynasty, thus sixty thousand square 
			yojana-s of the earth is dug over, so as to make the earth's outermost 
			plane as the unsurpassed <font color="#B3003A">rasaatala</font>, the 
			sixth subterranean and the nethermost plane. [1-39-21]

			Oh, the tigerly king Rama, the sons of Sagara have endeavoured everywhere 
			digging over the Jambu Island which is verily congested with mountains 
			in this way. [1-39-22]

			All the gods along with gandharva-s, asura-s, and reptiles who are 
			distraught at heart for the plight of earth have approached the Forefather, 
			Brahma. [1-39-23]

			They the gods who are very highly scared, and who are chap-fallen, 
			then spoke this sentence to the great-souled Forefather Brahma on gaining 
			his grace. [1-39-24]

			'Oh, god Brahma, the sons of Sagara are digging entire earth, thus 
			aquatic beings and many great-souls are being destroyed. [1-39-25]

            " 'This one is the destroyer of our ritual... this one has carried off 
			our ritual horse...' thinking thus and suspecting everyone those sons 
			of Sagara are torturing all the living beings.' Thus all the gods have 
			appealed to Brahma." So said Sage Vishvamitra to Rama and others. [1-39-26]

"The great-resplendent Vishvamitra on knowing through his ascetic power about the ruination of the sons 
of Vashishta, along with Mahodaya, proclaimed this amidst the observance of sages." Sage Shataananda 
continued his narration of Trishanku's legend. [1-60-1]

'This legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty is well-know as Trishanku, a righteous and benevolent one. He came 
under my shelter as he wishes to win over the heaven of gods with his own mortal body.' So Vishvamitra 
started to speak to sages. [1-60-2, 3b]

'You all scholars have to conduct Vedic-ritual along with in such a way as to how Trishnaku reaches 
the heaven of gods.' Thus Vishvamitra advised the conductors of the ritual. [1-60-3b, 4a]

On listening the words of Vishvamitra all those great-sages have come together and quickly discussed 
among themselves about what is agreeable to righteousness, as they are the knowers of scruples of conducting 
Vedic-rituals, but such a ritual is desultory. [1-60-4b, 5a]

Whatever Vishvamitra says let it be translated entirely and exhaustively into deeds called ritual. 
This Vishvamitra is the legatee of Sage Kushi, and indeed he is a saint similar to Ritual-fire besides 
being an extremely furious person. Otherwise this awesome sage gives curse, rancorously. [1-60-5b, 6]

'As such, let the Vedic-ritual be conducted intending and enabling Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku, 
to go to heaven by the ritualist prowess of Vishvamitra, therefor you conduct yourselves and you all 
preside over it.' Thus, the officiators conceded among themselves. [1-60-7, 8a]

Concluding thus those great-sages undertook concerned works of that Vedic-ritual and the great-resplendent 
Vishvamitra himself became its principal officiator. [1-60-8b, 9a]

Those hymnodists who are the experts in hymnodies have scripturally carried out all ceremonies 
in a methodical way with inviolable hymnal methods, and as per Kalpa treatise, that lays down the rules 
for conducting such rituals. [1-60-9b, 10a]

After a long time that highly ascetical Vishvamitra welcomed all the gods to receive their allotted 
oblations in that ritual. [1-60-10b, 11a]

Then all of the gods who are invited to partake of the oblation have not come forward to receive their 
allotments, and then the great-saint Vishvamitra, obsessive with fury, furiously lifted up a wooden-oblational-scoop, 
and said this to Trishanku. [1-60-11b, 12]

Oh, ruler of people, now you shall see the potency of my ascesis which I personally achieved. Such 
as I am I shall lead you forth to haven with your own body just by my personal capability. Oh, king 
of people, now you will go to heaven with your own mortal body, which is otherwise unattainable. [1-60-13, 
14a]

'May it be a little, but there is some fruit of my ascesis, isn't it! Oh, king, you will journey to 
heaven with your own body owing to that prowess of my ascesis.' Vishvamitra said so to Trishanku. [1-60-14b, 
15a]

"Once the sage Vishvamitra said those words, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, that king Trishanku soared to heaven 
with his mortal body, before the very eyes of other sages." Sage Shataananda continued. [1-60-15b, 16a]

On seeing Trishanku's entry into the realm of heaven, Indra, the subjugator of demon Paaka, spoke this 
sentence together with all the multitudes of gods. [1-60-16b, 17a]

Oh, Trishanku, you have not yet made heaven as your haunt, hence retrace your steps. As you are thrashed 
by the damning of your mentor Vashishta, you inane human, again fall down on earth, but with your head 
inversed. [1-60-17b, 18a]

When Mahendra said so, Trishanku loudly exclaiming at the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra saying, 'save 
me, save me,' and fell down from heaven. [1-60-18b, 19a]

On hearing the exclamatory sentence of Trishanku who is shouting it loudly, Vishvamitra assumed an 
abnormal anger and also said, 'wait... wait...' [1-60-19b, 20a]

Like the other Creator that resplendent Vishvamitra, himself staying among sages, has replicated Southerly 
Ursa Major in southerly direction. And still remaining amidst of sages that highly reputed sage Vishvamitra 
further started to replicate the stereotyped stocks of stars sequentially, resorting to the southern 
hemisphere, as he is convulsed in anger at Indra. [1-60-20b, 21, 22a]

On replicating the stereotyped stocks of other galaxies and stars, and while fury continued to blemish 
him Vishvamitra said, 'I will now clone an alternative Indra, or let that realm created by me remain 
without any Indra,' and when he is about to proceed to clone even gods in his wrath, the gods are startled. 
[1-60-22b, 23]

The gods are highly startled at Vishvamitra's creation, and they along with demons and with observances 
of hermits addressed the great-souled Vishvamitra with placatory words. [1-60-24]

'Oh great-fortunate Vishvamitra, this king Trishnaku is damned by his mentor, hence oh, ascetically 
wealthy sage, he is not at all eligible to go to heaven with his mortal body.' So said gods to Vishvamitra. 
[1-60-25]

On hearing that sentence of those gods, the eminent saint Kaushika spoke this highly laudable sentence 
to all of the gods. [1-60-26]

Let safety betide you all. I have promised to this king Trishanku that he will ascend to heaven with 
his mortal body, and I am not interested to make it untrue. [1-60-27]

'Let there be eternal heaven to Trishanku with his mortal body. Next, as along as the worlds remain, 
let all of these stars and galaxies I have created also remain eternally in their places as my creation. 
It will be apt of you all gods to accede to this.' So said Vishvamitra to gods. [1-60-28, 29]

When all the gods are addressed thus they replied the eminent saint Vishvamitra saying, 'so be it! 
Safe you be! Let all the created objects prevail in their respective places. Those amazing and numerous 
stars you have created will remain in firmament, but outside the path of stelliform of Cosmic Person. 
Trishanku will also remain in the circle of stars you created, but upside-down, for Indra's indict cannot 
be annulled, and he will be gleaming like a star and similar to any celestial. [1-60-30, 31, 32a]

'According to their wont to circumambulate someone who has gone to heavenly worlds, all the stars 
will suppliantly circumambulate this best king Trishanku, who has achieved his ends and who has become 
an acclaimed one with your tour de force.' So said gods to Vishvamitra in deterring his further cloning 
of a simulative Universe. [1-60-32b, 33a]

Even the benign-souled Vishvamitra, when reverenced by all gods, that great-resplendent sage without 
stirring himself from among the sages said to all gods, 'Agreed!' [1-60-33]

Oh, best one among men Rama, later at the end of that ritual great-souled gods and ascetically wealthy 
sages went away as they have come. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the narration of the legend. [1-60-34]

			king Dasharatha while dwelling in the city of Ayodhya protected the world, like 
			Manu, the foremost protector of mankind. [1-6-3,4,5]

			He that truth-abiding king, who adheres to the three-fold virtues rules the vast 
			of that kingdom from that best city Ayodhya, as Indra rules heaven from his capital 
			Amaravati. [1-6-5]

			In that best city Ayodhya all are exuberant yet virtuous ones, and scholars are 
			variously learned ones, people are satisfied with their own riches, they have 
			no greed, and they advocate truthfulness alone. [1-6-6]

			None with meagre accumulations is there in that great city and no householder 
			is there without unearned means, and without cows, horses, monies or cereals and 
			who could not sustain his family. [1-6-7]

			None can see a lustful person, or a miser or a cruel one anywhere in that Ayodhya, 
			along with nondescripts or non-believers, for there are no such persons. [1-6-8]

			All the ladies and gentlemen in that city are virtuous in mind, self-controlled 
			ones, they are all self-satisfied like great saints, and both in their conduct 
			and character they are blameless. [1-6-9]

			In that city none is there without his earrings, headgear, or garlands, none is 
			an enjoyer of lowly things, or misses his regular oil-baths, or with an un-creamed 
			body with sandalwood paste or with other body cream, or with an un-perfumed physique. 
			[1-6-10]

			There is none who is famsihed, an uncharitable one in his nature, one with an 
			undecorated body with ornaments like bracelets or chest plates, and there is none 
			without a heart. [1-6-11]

			There is none someone who is without sacrificial fires, and none without performing 
			sacrificial rituals, and none is low in living; neither an immoral, nor a bastard 
			nor even a thief, can be found in Ayodhya. [1-6-12]

			The sense-controlled scholarly Vedic Brahmans are always engaged in their rituals, 
			and they donate the education of Vedas to their students, as well practice their 
			own, and while receiving donations they are principle-minded. [1-6-13]

			There is no atheist, no liar, and none is less learnt in Veda-s, and no one is 
			found to be jealous, or disabled, or unscholarly person. [1-6-14]

			None can be found anywhere in Ayodhya without the knowledge of the six ancillaries 
			of Veda-s like astrology, prosody, grammar etc., none a non-performer of the prescribed 
			rituals, and none a non-donor in thousands, thus none with a saddened heart, turmoil 
			in mind or agonised in will is there. [1-6-15]

			Whoever it may be, either a gentleman or a lady, none is without wealth, even 
			none without elegance or devoid of devotion to their king, and it is impossible

			Longevity is there for all of the people, all are with virtuosity and truthfulness, 
			and they lived in that best city along with their sons, grandsons and their ladies. 
			[1-6-18]

			The warrior class Kshatriya-s is turned towards the Brahmans, the scholarly class, 
			for intellectual and religious support. The trading class, Vaisya-s, is the follower 
			of the Kshatriya-s, the ruling class, for the state's economy is dependent on 
			the rulership. And the fourth one, Shuudra-s, the working class, while performing 
			its own duties, is always working for the other castes. [1-6-19]

			That city is well protected by that king from Ikshwaku dynasty namely Dasharatha, 
			like Manu, the foremost king of mankind in earlier times. [1-6-20]

			That city Ayodhya is replete with firebrand like skillful warriors that are intolerant 
			of insults, and who have prosecuted their education in archery, chariot-wars, 
			swordplay etc. and with them it is like a cave replete with lions. [1-6-21]

			That city is full with best horses born in countries like Kaambhoja, Baahlika, 
			Vanaayu, and also in river-bed counties, which are like the horse of Indra namely 
			ucChaishrava. [1-6-22]

			Born in Vindhya Mountains, and also from Himalayan regions, mighty are the elephants 
			fully vigorous and fattened ones, and most powerful in their strength and each 
			in similitude is a huge mountain. [1-6-23]

			High bred from the classes of Airavata, the Elephant of Lord Indra, and from Mahapadma,

			In which city the great resplendent and admirable king Dasharatha resided, he 
			ruled the world from that city with silenced enemies, like the moon governing

			With gorgeous arches, castle-door-bars and with amazingly built houses that city

            "King Bhageeratha followed by Ganga has gone to the ocean-like ditch 
			which is dredged up by the sons of Sagara, and entered the subterranean 
			of earth where the sons of Sagara are rendered to ashes." Thus Vishvamitra 
			continued his narration about the Descent of Ganga. [1-44-1]

			While the waters of Ganga are inundating those ashes, oh, Rama, then 
			Brahma, the lord of all worlds, indeed spoke this to the king Bhageeratha. 
			[1-44-2]

			Oh, tigerly-man Bhageeratha, the sixty thousands sons of great souled 
			Sagara have crossed over the sea of mortality, and on a par with the 
			gods they have also transited to heaven. [1-44-3]

			As long as the water of the ocean abides in the world, oh, king, 
			so long the sons of Sagara will abide in heaven like gods. [1-44-4]

			This Ganga will become your eldest daughter and hereafter she will 
			remain renowned in the world with the name associated with your deed 
			of bringing her onto earth. [1-44-5]

			Henceforth heavenly Ganga will be renowned as 'Triple-path-cruiser' 
			and 'Bhaageerathi,' as well, and as this river is sanctifying three 
			worlds, namely, <font color="#B3003A">svarga, bhuu, paataala loka</font>-s, 
			'heaven, earth and netherworld' she will be remembered as the traveller 
			on triple path. [1-44-6]

			You may now offer water-oblations to all of your forefathers in the 
			waters of Ganga, oh, king, the lord of people, thus you may fulfil and 
			do away with the pledge of your requiescat. [1-44-7]

		    Your ancestor Sagara is a highly glorious one and a best one 
			among righteous persons, oh, king, even then he has not achieved this 
			aspiration of alighting Ganga in his lifetime, but you have achieved 
			it. [1-44-8]

			Like that, your grandfather Amshuman, who is unequalled in his resplendence 
			in this world and who had been praying for the descent of Ganga, he 
			also could not dispense with this vow on fulfilling it. [1-44-9]

			Oh, impeccable Bhageeratha, even by the kingly-sage Dileepa whose 
			resplendence is kindred to great sages, who is equal to me in his ascesis, 
			who is abided by the observances of ruling Kshatriya class, even by 
			such a highly fortunate and highly resplendent father of yours it was 
			impossible to bring Ganga in his turn, even though he had been supplicating 
			for the descent of Ganga throughout his lifetime. [1-44-10, 11]

			But, you have accomplished that pledge, oh, the best one among men, 
			and in the world you have achieved highest renown which is highly adorable 
			by all. [1-44-12]

			That 'Descent of Ganga' is perfected by you, oh, enemy-represser, 
			and by this you have acquired a genuine basis for righteousness in this 
			world, and thereby a base for yourself in my world, namely Abode of 
			Brahma. [1-44-13]

			Oh, phenomenal one, you may always take dip-baths in the holy water 
			of Ganga and oh, persona grata, thereby get purified of sins and thus 
			let your merit be fructified. [1-44-14]

			'You may now perform water-oblations to your forefathers with the 
			water of Ganga, let there be wellbeing to you, and oh, king, here I 
			go to my abode and you too may depart to yours.' Thus Brahma said to 
			Bhageeratha. [1-44-15]

			On saying in this way, the forefather of all the worlds, and the great 
			glorious lord of all gods, namely Brahma, went away to his empyrean 
			world as he has came. [1-44-16]

			On according those best water-oblations that endow superior realms 
			to the souls of sons of Sagara, according to precedency and the rationale 
			of scriptures, and even on offering water-oblations to other manes that 
			kingly-sage and greatly renowned Bhageeratha is sanctified, and then 
			only that king re-entered his own city, indeed when his purpose is completely 
			achieved, and oh, outstanding man Rama, thus that king Bhageeratha ruled 
			his kingdom well. [1-44-17, 18]

			On regaining him as their king the subjects of the kingdom are overjoyed, 
			and oh, Raghava, that king Bhageeratha too is relieved of his febrility 
			as his purpose is achieved and he is happy when devoid of haunting grief 
			of getting Ganga to earth. [1-44-19]

			Oh, Rama, this way I described to you about 'The Decent of Ganga' in 
			detail, thus you be blest and prosperous, and as the visceral time is 
			elapsing no more questions from you for now, and let us meditate on 
			Gayatri. But listen to the fruits of listening the legend of <em>
			ganga avataraNa,</em> 'The Descent of Ganga' [1-44-20]

			This legend is conducive to achieve prosperity, fame, longevity, progeny

			he is from Brahmans or from Kshatriya-s, or for that matter of fact 
			from any other class, his manes will be satisfied, and gods too will

			"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha-s, he who listens to this auspicious legend named 
			'The Descent of Gang,' which is an endower of longevity, all his wishes 
			are achieved, all his sins are obliterated, and his reputation and longevity

"Oh, Rama, the best one among men and the legatee of Raghu, on taking Shunashepa 
that highly renowned king Ambariisha took rest at noontime on the lakeside of Holy 
Lake." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shunashepa, as a part of Vishvamitra's 
legend. [1-62-1]

While the king Ambariisha is taking rest that highly brilliant Shunashepa came 
to the lakeside of main Holy Lake with high anxiety, and there he indeed saw his 
maternal uncle Sage Vishvamitra who is performing ascesis along with other sages. 
[1-62-2, 3a]

Shunashepa became pitiable and sulky faced by strain and thirst, oh, Rama, and 
he immediately fell in the lap of saint Vishvamitra saying this sentence. [1-62-3b, 
4a]

I have no mother or a father to save me. Then wherefore cousins or relatives 
will be there to protect me. Oh, peaceable saint the eminent, it will be apt of 
you to protect me according to saintliness. [1-62-4b, 5a]

Oh, illustrious sage, you alone are the saviour to each and every one, isn't 
it! You alone are the guardian angel, isn't it! Hence, let the purpose of the king 
Ambariisha be achieved, and let longevity come to me, and I on becoming imperishable 
and indeed on performing an unexcelled ascesis, I wish to enjoy in heavenly worlds. 
[1-62-5b, 6]

' You shall be my providence with a providential sentiment as I stand unprotected, 
and oh, virtue souled one, it will be apt of you to protect me from misfortune, 
like a father protecting his own son.' Thus Shunashepa appealed to Vishvamitra. 
[1-62-7]

On hearing that sentence of Shunashepa and on pacifying him in many ways, Vishvamitra 
of higher ascesis, indeed said this to his sons. [1-62-8]

For what reason parents engender sons, desiring positivity and for the purpose 
of welfare in the other worlds, this is the time that has come for fulfilling that 
reason. [1-62-9]

This youngster is the son of sage and he aspires shelter from me. Hence, oh, 
sons, give him satisfaction just by giving life to him. [1-62-10]

You all have done very good pious deeds and you all abide by probity. Hence, 
you bestow appeasement to Fire-god on your becoming the ritual-animals of king Ambariisha 
in lieu of this boy Shunashepa. [1-62-11]

'As a result, Shunashepa will have protectors, Vedic-ritual will be unimpeded, 
gods will be oblated, and my word too will be actualised.' Thus Vishvamitra said 
to his sons. [1-62-12]

But on hearing the saying of the sage, oh, Rama, the best of men, Madhushyanda 
and the other sons of Vishvamitra said this, haughtily and disparagingly. [1-62-13]

'On sacrificing your own sons how can you save another's son, oh, lordly father, 
we deem this as a wrongdoing and as good as dog's meat in a dinner.' Thus the sons 
of Vishvamitra replied their father. [1-62-14]

On listening that saying of his sons that eminent sage Vishvamitra started to curse 
them while fury reddened his eyes. [1-62-15]

You all have not only transgressed my word, but pertly replied me in an impudent 
manner which is abhorrent and hair-raising, and recriminatory according to probity. 
[1-62-16]

'You all will be whirling around the earth totally for a thousand years taking 
birth in the race that subsists on dog's meat, like the sons of Vashishta.' Thus 
Vishvamitra cursed his sons. [1-62-17]

On making his sons bounden by curse, then that best saint spoke to the pitiable 
Shunashepa, on making unharmed invulnerability to him with sanctifying hymns. [1-62-18]

When you are fastened with sacred fastener to the sacrificial post of Vishnu, 
smeared with red paste and garlanded with red garlands, you praisefully address 
the Fire-god with the words I going to impart to you in Vedic hymns. [1-62-19]

'These two divine hymns, oh, son of saint, shall be chanted in the Vedic-ritual 
of Ambariisha, then you will obtain your aspiration.' Thus Vishvamitra taught two 
Vedic hymns to the boy. [1-62-20]

Shunashepa having taken those two hymns from Vishvamitra very attentively has instantly 
gone to that lion-king Ambariisha and indeed spoke to him. [1-62-21]

'Oh, the lion-king, let us go promptly to your ritual place, oh, best king, you 
may apply yourself to your pledge in completing the ritual, with me as its sacrificial 
animal,' thus the boy said. [1-62-22]

On listening that sentence of the son of sage, the king Ambariisha is gladdened 
and proceeded to the ritual hall immediately and spiritedly. [1-62-23]

The king with the permission of officiators of ritual got the boy prepared as a 
ritual animal with sanctified bodily features and clad him in red clothes and got 
him securely fastened to the sacrificial post. [1-62-24]

When Shunashepa is tied to ritual post he immensely pleased two gods, namely Indra 
and Upendra as well, with those two hymns he got from Vishvamitra. [1-62-25]

Then the Thousand-eyed Indra who is satisfied with esoteric laudation is gladdened, 
and oh, Raghava, then he bestowed longevity to Shunashepa. [1-62-26]

Oh, Rama, the best one among men, he that king Ambariisha also obtained the fruits 
of that Vedic-ritual in manyfold, resulted from the grace of Thousand-eyed Indra. 
[1-62-27]

"Oh, Rama, the best among men, even the virtue-souled great ascetic Vishvamitra 
again performed ascesis at the same Holy lakeside for another thousand years." Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued the narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-62-28]

			"On listening the words of gods, Brahma, the Forefather of all the worlds, soothingly 
			spoke this to the celestials with sweet words. [1-37-5]

			" 'What the Daughter of Mountain, namely Goddess Uma, has said that 'you shall 
			have no posterity in your own wives' is true and it cannot be decried, and it 
			is unambiguous too. [1-37-6]

			" 'In whom the Fire-god can procreate an enemy-destroying Chief of Celestial Armies, 
			such an empyreal Ganga is there. [1-37-7]

			" 'The elder daughter King of Mountains, namely Ganga, will graciously welcome 
			the offspring from Fire-god, and that act of Ganga in welcoming the offspring 
			through Fire-god will also be pleasurable in many ways to the younger daughter 
			of King of Mountains, namely Uma, no doubt about it.' So said Brahma to all the 
			gods. [1-37-8]

			"On hearing those words of Brahma, oh, Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, all 
			the gods have praisefully worshipped him, as their ends are achieved at the bidding 
			fair of Brahma. [1-37-9]

			"On going to that supreme Mt. Kailash, oh, Rama, which is heaped up with many 
			ores, all of those gods have assigned the Fire-god to father a son. [1-37-10]

			" 'Oh, Fire-god, you please coordinate the mission of gods, oh, great-resplendent 
			god of Fire, you may release the potence of Shiva, which you have contained so 
			far, in the daughter of King of Mountains, namely River Ganga.' Thus, all gods 
			have requested the Fire-god. [1-37-11]

			"On assuring the gods that he will do his best, the Fire-god approached Ganga 
			entreating, 'Oh, Goddess Ganga, you verily bear pregnancy with the potence of 
			Shiva, since this is the select process of all the gods.' So said Fire-god to 
			River Ganga. [1-37-12]

			"On listening that sentence of Fire-god, River Ganga adopted a celestial form 
			readying herself, and on seeing her glorious mien the Fire-god seeped throughout 
			her. [1-37-13]

			"The Fire-god then drenched River Ganga from all over with the potence of Shiva 
			which he contained so far, oh, Raghu's delight Rama, and every rill and channel 
			of Ganga is replete with it. [1-37-14]

			"River Ganga then spoke this to the Fire-god who is in the lead of all gods, 'oh, 
			god, I am incapable to bear up the rampant fervour of yours, and while being burnt 
			with the fire of god Shiva compounded with that of yours my life-force is very 
			highly tortured.' [1-37-15, 16a]

			"He who consumes fire-oblations on behalf of all the gods, that Fire-god seeing 
			the miserable condition of River Ganga then spoke this to her, ''you may lay away 
			that embryo here at the side of Himalayan Mountains.' So said Fire-god to River 
			Ganga. [1-37-16b, 17a]

			"Oh, great-resplendent Rama, on hearing the words of Fire-god, oh, charming prince 
			Rama, River Ganga indeed ejected that great-radiant embryo of Shiva from all her 
			rills and channels. [1-37-17b, 18a]

			"Which refulgent embryo with the glitter of molten gold has emerged from River 
			Ganga is there that has reached earth, and from that the silver, and even the 
			gold with its matchless dazzle have emerged. [1-37-18]

			"In that process, copper and iron are also generated from that combustion of fires 
			of Shiva and Fire-god, and the residua have become tin and lead, and thus that 
			embryo on reaching the earth has evolved itself into various other elements also. 
			[1-37-19b, 20]

			"But, just when that embryo is laid down on Himalayan mountains, entire reed-garden 
			sprouted on that mountain is made brilliant by that glittering embryo and the 
			reed-garden itself has become golden. [1-37-21]

			"Oh, tigerly-man, from then onwards the gold with its brilliance equalling that 
			of the Fire-god is renowned by the name of <font color="#B3003A">jaataruupa</font> 
			, one that retains its birth-time form, and oh, Raghava, everything on the mountain, 
			say grass, trees, climbers, and shrubs, all have become golden. [1-37-22]

			"Then for the boy who took birth from the embryo deposited in Himalayas, the Wind-gods 
			along with Indra have arranged Krittika stars to simultaneously suckle him. [1-37-23]

			"Those Krittika stars have decided among themselves that 'this boy shall be the 
			son for all of us,' and on making such a best resolve they suckled the just born 
			boy. [1-37-24]

			"All the gods have then said, 'this boy will be renowned in all the three world 
			as Kaarthikeya, as Krittika-stars have suckled him, with any doubt.' [1-37-25]

"On hearing that blessing of gods Krittika stars gave a wash to that excellently 
auspicious boy who is radiant like fire, and who slid down from the secretion of 
the womb of Ganga. [1-37-26]

			"And gods called that boy, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, whose glow is like that of flaring 
			fire and who is ambidextrous as 'Skanda' for he slid down from the secretions 
			of a womb. [1-37-27]

			"Then an unexcelled milk instantly came forth from the breasts of the six Krittika-stars, 
			and becoming a six-faced one that boy too sucked that milk from the six Krittika-stars 
			at the same time. [1-37-28]

			"On sipping the milk just for one day he became an adolescent boy on that day 
			itself, and even though he is of delicate constitution as a boy, that taskmaster 
			triumphed over the army troops of demons by his own vigour. [1-37-29]

			"All of the celestial have then come together under the leadership of Fire-god 
			and they anointed that highly resplendent boy, Skanda, or Kaarthikeya, as the 
			Chief of Celestial Army troops. [1-37-30]

			"This way, I have vividly narrated the legend of Ganga to you, oh, Rama, like 
			that the Divine and Meritorious legend of the emergence of Kumara, namely Skanda 
			is also narrated. [1-37-31]

			"He who is a devotee of Kartikeyaa, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, he thrives with longevity, 
			also with sons, grandsons on this humanly earth in his mortal life, and on its 
			conclusion he becomes one with Skanda on journeying to Skanda's abode. [1-37-32]

Rama then travelled along with Lakshmana towards northeast direction keeping Vishvamitra afore and neared 
the hall of Vedic ritual of Janaka in Mithila kingdom. [1-50-1]

Rama who is with Lakshmana spoke to the tigerly saint Vishvamitra, " the Vedic-ritual of noble-souled 
Janaka is excellent, indeed with bountifully garnered paraphernalia of the ritual. [1-50-2]

"Oh, highly fortunate sage, this place abounds with many thousands of Brahmans who are experts in Vedic 
practises and who seem to be the dwellers of numerous provinces, and also discernable are the cottages 
of sages rife with hundreds of carts full with their ceremonial chattels, as such oh, Brahman, a campsite 
may be decided for us too, as I discern every inch is inhabited." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-50-3, 
4]

On hearing the words of Rama that great-saint Vishvamitra arranged a camp at an unfrequented place that 
has refreshing water. [1-50-5]

On hearing that Vishvamitra has arrived in Mithila, then the best king Janaka instantly forged ahead 
towards Vishvamitra, keeping his unreprovable priest Shataananda afore of the team, in deference to 
Vishvamitra. [1-50-6, 7a]

Even the Ritvik-s, the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, of the great souled king Janaka arrived 
with post-haste taking holy waters, and they have ritualistically offered that sanctified water to Vishvamitra. 
[1-50-7b, 8a]

On receiving that veneration from the great souled Janaka, Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of 
the king Janaka, as well about the unhindered proceedings of that Vedic-ritual. [1-50-8b, 9a]

Then Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of saints, mentors, clerics, as befitting to their order, 
and joined the company of all of the sages as a happy-souled sage. [1-50-9b, 10a]

The king Janaka adjoining his palms then spoke to that eminent-sage Vishvamitra, "oh, reverend sage, 
please be seated on this high seat, along with these eminent saints in their respective seats." Thus 
Janaka spoke to Vishvamitra [1-50-10b, 11a]

On hearing the words of Janaka that great-sage Vishvamitra took his seat, and king Janaka also took 
seat along with his royal priest Shataananda, and the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, namely Ritvik-s, 
and along with his ministers. [1-50-11b, 12a]

On beholding all of them seated all about in their respective seats as demanded by procedure king Janaka 
then spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-50-12b, 13a]

Today my Vedic ritual is enriched with your advent, whereby I deem that gods have fructified the ritual. 
Let the ritual be like that. I deem that I have obtained the fruit of the ritual just on seeing godlike 
you here today. [1-50-13b, 14a]

Oh, Brahman, at which Vedic-ritual hall you have arrived along with so many sages that happens to be 
mine, whereby, oh, eminent saint, I feel that I am honoured and hallowed. [1-50-14b, 15a]

"Oh, Brahma-sage, the scholarly Ritvik-s conducting my Vedic-ritual are saying that only twelve more 
days are remaining to complete the observation of ritual-pledge, and then oh, Kaushika, it will be apt 
of you to see the gods who arrive at the conclusion of this Vedic-ritual expecting their due in the 
ritual." So said king Janaka to Vishvamitra. [1-50-15b, 16a]

On speaking to that tigerly sage Vishvamitra in this way, the king again asked the sage pointedly and 
inquisitively with adjoined palms and with a gladdened face. [1-50-16b, 17a]

These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious elephants and arrogant 
lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, 
and bows, are valorous with their valour matching that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals 
and with youthfulness in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, 
by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals have chanced 
on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have come here, and whose scions are 
they? [1-50-17b, 18, 19]

Oh, great-saint, whose sons are these two valiant youngsters who are brandishing best weapons? They 
are embellishing this province as the Sun and Moon doeth the sky. Each to each they are clonal by postural-language, 
by facial-language and by body language. They appear valorous but boyish in their appearance, as their 
curls are still jet-black like crow-wings. Thus, whether they are immature by age though mature by their 
valour or so, I wish to listen about them in actuality. [1-50-20, 21]

On hearing the words of great-souled Janaka, Vishvamitra whose anima is immeasurable, has announced 
that those two as the sons of king Dasharatha. [1-50-22]

The highly resplendent great-saint Vishvamitra has informed the high souled Janaka about the coming 
of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, their stopping over there and elimination 
of demons at that place, their indefatigable travel along with him, beholding City of Vishaala, seeing 
Ahalya, her reuniting with Sage Gautama, likewise their coming hitherward to gain a grasp of great bow 
of Shiva. On informing all these incidents to Janaka as well as to Shataananda, who incidentally is 
the son of Ahalya, sage Vishvamitra paused. [1-50-23, 24, 25]

	On hearing the essence of Ramayana from Sage Narada, which is abound with probity and 
	prosperity, and a propitious one too, that virtue-souled Valmiki started searching for 
	further known details in the legend of that dexterous Rama. [1-3-1]

	Valmiki sitting on a sacred grass mat, whose apices are towards east, touched waters, 
	and made his palms adjoined in reverence, and then by his yogic insight started to search

Then, in the fresh of the morning those enemy destroyers, Rama and Lakshmana, arrived at the 
riverbank of Ganga keeping sage Vishvamitra ahead of them, which sage has just completed his 
ritualistic chores of dawn. [1-24-1]

All those sages of Kaama's hermitage that are the great souls and scrupulous ones in their 
vows, have positioned an auspicious ferryboat within the reach in the river, and then they 
said to sage Vishvamitra. [1-24-2]

"You may board the boat keeping the princes ahead of you, and we wish you to proceed on a 
prosperous route without the shift of time." So said the sages. [1-24-3]

Sage Vishvamitra on saying 'it must be so,' to those sages and revering them in his turn, 
cruised the river that itself is cruising towards ocean, along with both the princes. [1-24-4]

On coming to the midstream of water there Rama heard an unusual and increasing noise of gushy 
waters along with his younger brother, and that brilliant one Rama desired to know its significance. 
[1-24-5, 6a]

Rama then asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra in the midst of the river, "what is this turbulent 
sound sire, as though slashing water?" [1-24-6b, 7a]

On hearing the inquisitive words of Raghava that virtue-souled sage Vishvamitra started to 
tell the significance of that sound. [1-24-7b, 8a]

"On Mt. Kailash Brahma created a great lake at his will, oh, tigerly-man Rama, hence that 
is called Maanasa Lake. [1-24-8b, 9a]

"That river which spontaneously flows out of that Maanasa Lake surrounds Ayodhya city is this 
one, the River Sarayu. Because this has originated from a lake, <font color="#B3003A">saraH</font>, 
this is known as Sarayu. And because it flows from Brahma's Lake it is a merited river. This 
is the remarkable noise of such a Sarayu River in its coursing towards River Ganga, generated 
by the collision of their waters, and Rama, offer regards to these rivers, respectfully." 
So said Vishvamitra to the princes. [1-24-9b, 10, 11a]

Offering their salutations to River Sarayu and Ganga those two most virtuous and agile footed 
princes proceeded further on reaching the southern riverbank. [1-24-11b, 12a]

On seeing a horrendous and uninhibited forest, Rama, the son of the best king Dasharatha asked 
the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-24-12b, 13a]

"Oh, impenetrable is this forest fraught with swarms of crickets, brutish predators, and vultures, 
which are all horribly strident. [1-24-13b, 14a]

"Various vultures are screeching with fierce sonority, and tigers, wild boars, and elephants 
render this forest atypical. [1-24-14b, 15a]

"Indeed, what is this wretched forest that is dense with Dhava, Ashvakarna, Arjuna, Bilva, 
Tinduka, Patala, and Badari trees." Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-24-15b, 16a]

The resplendent and the great saint Vishvamitra then said to Rama, "I will tell you, oh, my 
boy Rama, whose is this wretched forest. [1-24-16b, 17a]

"Once these were vast provinces, oh, best one among men, designed by gods and known as Malada 
and Karuusha. [1-24-17b, 18a]

"Once upon a time, oh, Rama, mortal impurities of filth and hunger completely stained Indra 
when he eliminated demon Vritra, as he committed the sin of killing of a Brahman, where the 
demon Vritra was incidentally a Brahman. [1-24-18b, 19a]

"The gods and ascetically rich sages then started to bathe feculent Indra with their handy 
vessels for the riddance of his defilement. [1-24-19b, 20a]

"On giving filth and hunger emerged out of the body of Mahendra here on the earth then the 
gods were gladdened. [1-24-20b, 21a]

"As and when Indra was without desecration and hunger as well, and thus purified, then gladdened 
about this place he gave it an unexcelled boon. [1-24-21b, 22a]

"These provinces that bear the impurity of my body shall become resourceful and they shall 
attain renown in world as Malada and Karusha." Thus Indra gave boon to this place. [1-24-22b, 
23a]

"On observing the honour accorded by wise Indra to these places gods praised the controller 
of demon Paaka, namely Indra saying, 'splendid, splendid it is.' [1-24-23b, 24a]

"For a long time these habitations Malada and Karuusha were affluent, oh, enemy subjugator 
Rama, and people were happy with wealth and provisions. [1-24-24b, 25a]

"Later at sometime, a yaksha female who is a guise changer at her wish, possessor of the strength 
of a thousand elephants, wife of clever Sunda, and she whose son is demon Mareecha, the 
one equal to Indra in his bravery, prevailed here, let you be safe Rama. [1-24-25b, 26, 27a]

"That demon Mareecha is round shouldered, huge headed, cavernous mouthed, and gigantic bodied 
one, and he is always terrifying the people. [1-24-27b, 28a]

"And Raghava, that malevolent Tataka is always destroying the inhabitations at Malada and 
Karusha. [1-24-28b, 29a]

"She lives about one and half yojana distance from here, and by which reason this became the 
forest of Tataka, owing to her gruesome activities, for that reason only a headway is to be 
made, to eradicate her and her activities. [1-24-29b, 30a]

"Depending upon the strength of your own self-confidence you have to eradicate this evildoer, 
and assigned by me you have to make this province free from thorniness. [1-24-30b, 31a]

"Indeed, none is able to enter this sort of province, Rama, destroyed by the hazardous 
and invincible unearthly being who turned into a demoness, namely Tataka, hence you have to 
make the provinces habitable. [1-24-31b, 32a]

"As to how that ghoulish Tataka destroyed this entire forest, rendering it as a devastated 
place, without refraining from it even today, all that is narrated." So said Vishvamitra to 
Rama. [1-24-32]

When Vashishta spoke in this way, the great-mighty Vishvamitra brandishing Fiery-missile 
challenged Vashishta saying, "withstand this, withstand this..." Thus, sage Shataananda 
continued his narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-56-1]

That reverential sage Vashishta then upraising his Brahma-baton, which is like 
the other baton of the Terminator, spoke this sentence furiously. [1-56-2]

I am staying here only, you meritless Kshatriya, you may clearly display whatever 
prowess you have, oh, Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra, I will now ruin whatever vanity 
you or your missiles have. [1-56-3]

"Where stands the force of belligerence when compared to the supreme force of 
sagacity, you abased Kshatriya, watch out for my strength of seraphic sagacity." 
So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-56-4]

With his baton of Brahma Vashishta silenced that matchless and deadly Fiery-missile 
of Gaadhi's son, namely Vishvamitra, as a deluge of water silencing a rage of fire. 
[1-56-5]

Vishvamitra, the son of Gaadhi then rancorously fusilladed the missiles regulated 
by gods like Varuna, Rudra, Indra, Paashupata, and even a missile which is projectile 
through grass blade called Ishiika. [1-56-6]

Vishvamitra also launched missiles named Humane, Rager, Stupefier, Hypnotiser, 
Yawner, Intoxicator, also thus Humidifier, Weep-inducer. [1-56-7]

He also launched the missiles called Drainer and Ripper, and the highly unconquerable 
Thunderbolt, even the lassos of Brahma, Time and Rain-gods. [1-56-8]

Also missiles called Shiva, Monster, Punisher, Wrester and like that the Baffler, 
Bolter, Drier, Drencher are launched. [1-56-9]

And he launched discs called the Discs of Virtue, Time and Vishnu and he also launched 
other missiles like the Blower, Stirrer and like that the missile with Horse-head. 
[1-56-10]

A pair of powers are launched, namely Power of Vishnu and the Power of Rudra, like 
that the Impeller, Crowbar, and a great missile called Staggerer, and then he launched 
the lethal missile of the Time. [1-56-11]

Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, Vishvamitra on triggering off all these missiles 
then he launched the deadly Trident, Skull and Torque missiles on Vashishta, and 
whole thing has became a spectacular display of Vishvamitra's arsenal. [1-56-12, 
13a]

Brahma's son Vashishta defused all of those missiles just with his baton and when 
all of them are thus silenced, Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra touched off Brahma's missile. 
[1-56-13b, 14a]

When Vishvamitra brandished and set up Brahma missile for launching, seeing it 
all the gods keeping the Fire-god at their vanguard, godly sages, reptiles along 
with gandharva-s are perplexed, and the triad of worlds itself is perturbed. [1-56-14b, 
15]

Even that deleteriously destructive Brahma's missile is completely consumed with 
the seraphic resplendence of Brahma-baton of Sage Vashishta. [1-56-16]

The appearance of that great-souled Vashishta became appallingly perplexing when 
he is finishing off that Brahma missile as if to surely petrify the Tri-world. [1-56-17]

From all of the pits of hair of that great-souled Vashishta ramified are the raditional 
beams and those radiated shafts are rolling up with the fumes of radiation, so to 
speak. [1-56-18]

The baton of Brahma gripped in his hand and upraised by Vashishta is highly glowing 
as if it is the fumeless inferno of Time, and as if it is the earthly baton of Yama, 
the Terminator. [1-56-19]

'The assemblages of saints then extolled the best meditator Vashishta saying, 'oh, 
Brahman, infallible is your prowess, but bear this combustion of missile by your 
own combustive power. Though Vishvamitra is a supreme ascetic he is forestalled 
by you and your seraphic power, but this power of yours is equally anguishing all 
the worlds. Hence, let the worlds survive shooing away their anguish caused by your 
prowess. Oh, Brahman, be gracious, for you are the best among the best meditators...' 
So said saints to Vashishta. [1-56-20, 21]

When that great-resplendent Vashishta is spoken thus by saints and gods he composed 
himself, and then that estranged Vishvamitra spoke this to himself with heavy suspiration. 
[1-56-22]

Fie upon the might of Kshatriya, mightier is the might of Brahman's resplendence, 
only with one baton of Brahma all of my missiles are defused. [1-56-23]

" 'Therefore on analysing this matter, I with my heart and senses quietened will 
embark on a sublime ascesis which really will be the causative factor for according 
Brahma-Sage-hood.' So thought Vishvamitra..." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his 
narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-56-24]

On hearing that sentence of that intellectual sage Vishvamitra, the highly refulgent 
and the great ascetic Shataananda is overjoyed, and Sage Shataananda, the eldest 
son of Sage Gautama, and whose radiance is brightened by his own ascesis is highly 
amazed just on seeing Rama. [1-51-1, 2]

On raptly observing those two princes who are sitting comfortably with their heads 
bending down submissively, then Shataananda spoke to the eminent sage Vishvamitra. 
[1-51-3]

Oh, tigerly saint Vishvamitra, you have revealed my glorious mother Ahalya who 
meted out a marathon ascesis to the princes - Really! [1-51-4]

And the highly resplendent and celebrated mother of mine worshipped Rama, who is 
worthy of worship by every corporeal being, with forest produce, is it so! [1-51-5]

Oh, great-resplendent Vishvamitra, you have narrated to Rama about the maltreatment 
of my mother by the Providence as has happened anciently, isn't it![1-51-6]

Oh, the best sage Kaushika, you be safe, my mother is reunited with my father on 
beholding and giving hospitality to Rama - Really! [1-51-7]

Oh, Kaushika, my father came to my mother's place from Himalayas! Has the great 
resplendent father of mine worshipped Rama because the redemption of my mother is 
per the kindness of Rama! Has this great-souled Rama reverenced that great resplendent 
father of mine by according a redemption, <font color="#B3003A">ahalyaa-daana</font>, 
the endowment of Ahalya to her husband. [1-51-8]

"Oh, Kaushika, on his arrival at my mother's place whether this reverential Rama 
reverenced my father with a pacified heart without becoming contumelious!" Thus 
sage Shataananda exclaimed at the marvel occurred through Rama. [1-51-9]

On hearing that sentence of his, that great-saint and sentence-precisian Sage Vishvamitra, 
replied the sentence-precisionist Sage Shataananda. [1-51-10]

"I have done whatever good is to be done and nothing is left undone, and the wife 
of the sage, namely Ahalya, is reunited with her husband sage Gautama, as with Renuka 
who was reunited with sage Jamadagni, the descendent of Bhrigu." So said Vishvamitra. 
[1-51-11]

On hearing those words of that highly intellectual Vishvamitra, high refulgent sage 
Shataananda spoke these words to Rama. [1-51-12]

Hail to thee! Oh, best one among men Rama, your arrival is a godsend, not only 
to Mithila but to entire humanity, and oh, Raghava, as an undefeatable great-sage 
Vishvamitra spearheads you, so shall your mission be undefeatable, thus hail to 
thee! [1-51-13]

This highly resplendent Vishvamitra's exploits are unimaginable. He attained the 
highest order of Brahma-sage by his ascesis, thus illimitable is his ascetic resplendence, 
and you have to know him as an ultimate course, not only to you alone, but also 
to one and all. [1-51-14]

None other than you is fortunate enough on earth, oh, Rama, as you are in the custodial 
care of Vishvamitra, the scion of Kushika, who has practised supreme ascesis. [1-51-15]

What is the prowess of the great-souled Vishvamitra, and what the quintessence 
of his legend may be heard from me while I narrate it. [1-51-16]

This probity-souled Vishvamitra, being a proficient in rectitude, a perfectionist 
in kingcraft, a proponent of people's welfare, more so a persecutor of enemies, 
was there as a king for a long time. [1-51-17]

There was a king named Kusha, a brainchild of Prjaapati, and Kusha's son was the 
powerful and verily righteous Kushanaabha. [1-51-18]

One who is highly renowned by the name Gaadhi was the son of Kushanaabha, and Gaadhi's 
son is this great-saint of great resplendence, Vishvamitra. [1-51-19]

Vishvamitra ruled the earth, and this great-resplendent king ruled the kingdom 
for many thousands of years. [1-51-20]

At one time the great-resplendent king Vishvamitra went round the earth marshalling 
a unit of <font color="#B3003A">akshauhini</font> army. [1-51-21]

Moving sequentially about the provinces, cities, rivers likewise mountains, king 
Vishvamitra arrived at the threshold of a hermitage which is with numerous flowered 
trees and climbers, overspread with very many herds of animals, adored by the celestials 
like siddha-s and caarana-s, frequented and embellished with gods, demons, gandharva-s, 
and kinnara-s, spread out with equable deer, adored by flights of birds, compacted 
with the assemblages of Brahma-sages, and also with the assemblages of godly-sages 
who are fully accomplished in their ascesis, where the personal resplendence of 
each of the great-souled sage is similar to each of the Ritual-fire available in 
each of the Ritual Fire Altar before which he is sitting, and which hermitage is 
bustling with the activity of great-souled sages who are comparable to Brahma, among 
whom some subsist on water alone, and some on air alone, likewise some more on dry 
leaves, while some on fruits, tubers, and with such of those sages and also with 
particular sages like Vaalakhilyaa-s, also with others like Vaikhaanasa-s, who are 
all self-controlled, who have overcame their peccabilites, who have overpowered 
their senses that hermitage is occupied, and while everyone of the inmates is engaged 
in meditations and oblations into Ritual-fire, and with such sages and their activity 
whole of the perimeter of that hermitage is brightened and rendered splendent, and 
king Vishvamitra arrived at such a magnificent hermitage of Sage Vashishta. [1-51-22, 
23, 24, 2125, 26, 27, 28a]

"And this best one among vanquishers and the great-stalwart Vishvamitra has then 
seen the hermitage of Vashishta which is like the worldly Universe of Brahma." Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-51-28]

The emasculated Indra then with panicked eyes spoke to gods, siddha-s, gandharva-s, 
and carana-s, keeping Fire-god as their helms-god. [1-49-1]

I have Indeed incited fury in that noble-souled Sage Gautama by effectuating 
hindrance in his asceticism, but I have accomplished a task of gods. [1-49-2]

By Gautama's anger I am rendered testicle-less and his wife Ahalya is also rejected 
by the sage, and thus by his releasing a severe curse his propriety for ascesis 
is dwindled, therefore his ascesis is pre-empted by me. [1-49-3]

'Therefore, oh, all gods with the assemblages of sages and caarana-s, it will 
be apt of you to make me virile again, as I have acted for the benefit of gods.' 
Thus Indra spoke to all gods. [1-49-4]

On hearing the words of the officiator for Hundred-Vedic-rituals, namely Indra, 
all of the gods and other assemblages of celestials, together with the groups of 
Marut-gods came to the godly manes keeping the Fire-god in van, and appealed. [1-49-5]

'This ram is with testicles and Indra is indeed rendered testicle-less. Taking 
the testicles of this ram they may be given to Indra quickly.' Thus Fire-god started 
his appeal to manes. [1-49-6]

'This ram that is being offered to you shall now be gelded to give its testes 
to Indra, and though this ram is deprived of its organ it will be complete and it 
endows complete satisfaction to you. To those humans who hereafter offer testes-less 
rams in sacrifices for the purpose of your gratification, you shall truly offer 
them plentiful and unmitigated benefits.' Thus Agni, the Fire-god spoke to manes. 
[1-49-7]

On hearing the words of Agni, the Fire-god, the manes-gods who gathered to collect 
their share of offering have extricated that ram's testes, which is not yet sacrificed 
but tethered to a sacrificial post, and offered them to the Thousand-eyed Indra. 
[1-49-8]

Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, from then onwards the manes-gods who come to collect their 
share are enjoying even the goats, even if they do not have testes, to endow benefits 
thereof to those that offer those goats, and to join the testes of goats to Indra. 
[1-49-9]

Oh, Raghava, owing to the efficacy of the great-souled Gautama and his ascesis, 
from then onwards Indra has became one with the testes of a goat. [1-49-10]

"Therefore, oh, great-resplendent Rama, enter the hermitage of Gautama whose deeds 
are pietistic, and atone Ahalya who is highly fortunate and who is in the compose 
of a divinity." Thus Vishvamitra spoke to Rama. [1-49-11]

On hearing Vishvamitra's words Rama entered the hermitage along with Lakshmana and 
keeping Vishvamitra afore. [1-49-12]

She whose splendour is brightened by her ascesis, at whom it is impossible to raise 
an eye for a stare either for gods, or for demons, or for the worldly beings on 
coming close to her, whom the Creator has contrived with careful contemplation as 
an angelic and a completely phantasmal entity, who is like the befogged and beclouded 
moonshine of a full moon as she is hitherto enshrouded by the dried up leaves and 
dust, who is like an unwatchable sunshine mirrored in and glowing from the midst 
of water, for she is hitherto in the midst of denounce, and whose limbs are like 
the tongues of a flaring fire around which fumes are cloaking, as she is hitherto 
practising an utmost ascesis subsisting on air alone, which ascesis alone made her 
like a flaring Ritual Fir, and Rama has seen such a highly glorious Ahalya. [1-49-13, 
14, 15]

Ahalya is indeed indiscernible to all the three worlds by the very word of Gautama 
until the manifestation of Rama. [1-49-16a, b]

On reaching the end of curse she came into the view of Raghava-s, and they too gladly 
touched her feet in reverence. [1-49-16c, 17a]

Reminiscing Gautama's words Ahalya received those two, and self-consciously offered 
water for feet and hand washing, and like that she also offered guestship customarily 
and dutifully, and Rama of Kakutstha on his part acquiesced her hospitality. [1-49-18]

There chanced an abundant floral fall form firmament to the drumbeats of god's drums, 
and the celestials like gandharva-s, apsara-s revelled in a splendid festivity that 
is superb. [1-49-19]

Gods have collectively reverenced her, whose limbs are depurated by the asset of 
her ascesis which is performed as a devotee of Gautama remaining in his directives, 
saying 'Gracious! Goodness!' [1-49-20]

Even that great-resplendent Gautama is heartened when he reunited with Ahalya after 
a long, long a time, and that sage customarily reverenced Rama for actualising his 
solemn utterance, and that great-ascetic Gautama continued his ascesis together 
with Ahalya. [1-49-21]

Even Rama on receiving a conventionally high veneration in the manifestness of that 
great-saint Gautama himself, then moved ahead to Mithila. [1-49-22]

When those two, Vishvamitra and Sumati, have met one another there at that place, 
king Sumati raised the topic of Rama and Lakshmana, after exchanging greetings and 
enquiring about the well-being of the great-saint Vishvamitra. [1-48-1]
  
"These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious 
elephants and arrogant lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine 
bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, and bows, are valorous with their valour matching 
that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals and with youthfulness 
in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, 
by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals 
have chanced on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have 
come here, and whose scions are they? [1-48-2, 3, 4]

"These two best ones among men are identical to one another by their bodily proportion, 
facial-language, and by bodily gestures, and with their presence they refurbish 
this province like the Moon and Sun brightening the firmament. In truth, I would 
like to know for what reason these valiant ones who are wielding best weapons have 
arrived here travelling on an arduous path." Thus, king Sumati asked Vishvamitra. 
[1-48-5, 6]

On hearing those words of King Sumati, Vishvamitra informed him about the visit 
of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, also about the elimination 
of demons, as it has happened. [1-48-7a, 7b]

King Sumati is highly astonished to hear the words of Vishvamitra about the visit 
of Rama and Lakshmana, and treating them to have come as the most prominent and 
honour-worthy guests that king started to honour those two great-mighty sons of 
Dasharatha customarily. [1-48-7c, 8]

On getting high honours from King Sumati, Raghava-s stayed there along with Vishvamitra 
and with the community of sages for one night, and then they all have moved on to 
Mithila. [1-48-9]

On seeing Janaka's auspicious city Mithila, all of the saints who are accompanying 
Vishvamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana, extolled it saying, "Splendid! Splendid!" and 
admired it highly. [1-48-10]

On seeing a hermitage in the fringes of Mithila, that appeared to be age-old, but 
now uninhabited, yet pleasing, Rama asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-48-11]

"This is semblable to a hermitage but sages seem to have discarded it. Oh, venerable 
sage, whose is this hermitage previously, I wish to listen of it." Thus, Rama asked 
Vishvamitra. [1-48-12]

On hearing that sentence spoken by Raghava, the expert in sententiousness, a great 
resplendent sage and eminent-saint Vishvamitra replied him in this way. [1-48-13]

What a pleasure! You may listen as I narrate, Raghava, whose hermitage is this 
factually, and which great soul has resentfully cursed this. [1-48-14]

Oh, the best one among men Rama, this hermitage with a heavenly glisten, and highly 
hallowed even by gods, once belonged to the great-souled sage Gautama. [1-48-15]

In this hermitage, oh, prince Rama, once that highly renowned Sage Gautama sat 
tight in asceticism for numerous cycle of years along with his wife Ahalya. [1-48-16]

On knowing the meantime of Gautama's availability at hermitage, Indra, the husband 
of Shaci Devi and the Thousand-eyed god wearing the guise of sage Gautama and becoming 
such a sage, approached Ahalya and said this to her. [1-48-17]

Oh, finely limbed lady, indulgers do not watch out for the time to conceive, 
as such oh, slender-waisted one, I desire copulation with you. [1-48-18]

Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, though knowing him as the Thousand-eyed Indra in 
the guise of her husband Gautama, she is inclined to have intercourse ill-advisedly, 
only to satisfy the impassion of the King of Gods. [1-48-19]

She felt fulfilled in her heart of hearts and then she said this to that best god 
Indra, 'I am gratified in complying with your wish, oh, best of gods, get going 
oh, lord, from here quickly, oh, ruler of gods, always safeguard yourself and me 
from Sage Gautama.' Thus, Ahalya said to Indra. [1-48-20, 21a]

Indra on his part smilingly said this word to Ahalya, 'oh, well-hipped lady, I 
am quite delighted, here I go as I have came.' [1-48-21b, 22a]

Oh, Rama, Indra then came out of the cottage flustering hurriedly after copulating 
with her with an uncertainty about the arrival of Sage Gautama. [1-48-22b, 23a]

Indra looked at Gautama..the one who is great saint, inaccessible to gods and demons, full of ascetic power,
purified with holy water, bright like fire, holding Samidha-s and kusha grass in hands,
and eminent Sage entering into the hermitage. [1-48-23b, 24, 25a]

On seeing the sage the lord of gods Indra is scared and became dreary-faced. Then 
the well-behaved Gautama furiously spoke these words on seeing the ill-behaved Thousand-eyed 
Indra who is donning the guise of a saint. [1-48-25b, 26]

'Oh, dirty-minded Indra, taking hold of my form you have effectuated this unacceptable 
deed, whereby you shall become infecund.' Thus, Gautama cursed Indra. [1-48-27]

When that great-souled sage Gautama spoke that way with rancour, the testicles 
of the cursed Thousand-eyed Indra fell down onto ground at that very moment. [1-48-28]

On cursing Indra thus the sage cursed even his wife saying, 'you shall tarry here 
for many thousands of years to come without food and consuming air alone, and unseen 
by all beings you shall live on in this hermitage while contritely recumbent in 
dust.' [1-48-29, 30]

When that unassailable son of Dasharatha, namely Rama, arrives at this squalid 
forest, for it will be henceforth rendered so along with you, then you will be purified. 
[1-48-31]

'On your welcoming Rama, oh, ill-behaved woman, you will be divested of your greed 
and craze in which you lingered so far, and then you will assume your own body and 
then you can be in my proximity, rejoicingly.' Thus, Sage Gautama cursed his wife 
Ahalya. [1-48-32]

"On cursing immodest Ahalya thus, that great-resplendent Sage Gautama shed this 
hermitage which was once adored by celestials like siddha-sand caarana-s, and that 
great-ascetic Gautama practised his asceticism on the pleasant peaks of Himalayas." 
Thus, Vishvamitra continued his narration about the legend of Ahalya. [1-48-33]

On the departure of Rama of Jamadagni, that most glorious Rama of Dasharatha is quietened at heart, and he gave away that 
longbow of Vishnu into the hand of inimitable Rain-god. [1-77-1]

On paying respects to sage Vashishta and to the other important sages, Rama, the delight of Raghu's lineage, placatingly 
addressed his agitated father Dasharatha. [1-77-2]

"Rama of Jamadagni has gone on his way, you may now order the army under your wardship, for which you are the lord, 
to move on towards Ayodhya..." So said Rama to his father. [1-77-3]

On hearing the words of Rama king Dasharatha hugged his son with both of his arms, and kissed on the forehead of Raghava, 
and king Dasharatha is gladdened to listen about the departure of Parashu Rama, and then he is further gladdened in deeming 
that he and his sons took a rebirth. [1-77-4, 5]

Then the King Dasharatha ordered that legion to move ahead, and then they all went towards delightful city Ayodhya, whose 
royal highways are wetted with water, sprinkled with bunches of flowers, decorated with banners and bannerettes up above 
them, and reverberating with high sounding bugle-horns. Further, those highways are replete with urbanites welcomers who 
are handling welcoming kits which are golden handy-crates or plates in which lit camphor, fragrant incenses, vermilion powder, 
flowers to shower on the incomers are arranged, and those highways are well-decorated with throngs of people who are glee-faced 
at their king's re-entry, and into such an exhilarating city Ayodhya king Dasharatha and his retinue entered. [1-77-7, 8a]

When the citizenry and city-dwelling Brahman-s have received him from a distance, that illustrious king Dasharatha followed 
by his phenomenal and praiseworthy sons then entered his happy house and home, which is like the lofty and lordly Himalayan 
palazzo. [1-77-8b, 9]

In palace king Dasharatha is overjoyed when he is surrounded with his own inmates of palace-chambers, and when his long 
cherished ambitions have come true, while his queens, Kausalya, Sumitra, and slender waisted Kaikeyi and other wives are 
overjoyed in the functions of receiving the four brides. [1-77-10]

Then the womenfolk of the king welcomed the highly propitious Seetha and the highly fortunate Urmila too, along with both 
the daughters of Kushadhvaja, namely Maandavi and Shrutakiirti, with pageantry and festivity. [1-77-11b, 12a]

All of the brides and bridegrooms clad in silks promptly worshipped the gods in sanctums to the benedictory chanting of 
Vedic hymns and Ritual-fires, thus they shone forth like the tongues of Holy Fires of Vedic Altars. [1-77-12b, 13a]

Then all the princesses paid respects to all of the respectable ones, and they luxuriated in sequestered palace-chambers 
along with their husbands. [1-77-13b, 14a]

And those best men among men, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, who are by now accomplished persons in weaponry and 
whose marriages have also come to pass, occupied themselves in the welfare of kingdom while assisting their father and moving 
around with good hearted people. [1-77-14b, 15a]

Then after sometime that king Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, spoke to his and Kaikeyi's son, Bharata. [1-77-15b, 16a]

"This is your maternal uncle and the son of king of Kekaya, and this valiant Yudhaajit came here to take you to Kekaya province, 
and he is staying behind because of your marriage..." thus Dasharatha bade farewell to Bharata suggesting that Bharata may 
now go with Yudhaajit. [1-77-16b, 17a]

On hearing the opinion of Dasharatha, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, then readied himself to travel along with Shatrughna 
to Kekaya province. [1-77-17b, 18a]

That valiant and best one among men Bharata on asking leave from his father, from Rama, an uncomplicatedly dextrous one 
in undertaking deeds, and even from his mothers, Kaikeyi, Sumitra, and Kausalya, travelled on along with Shatrughna. [1-77-18b, 
19a]

Yudhaajit on clinching not only Bharata, but Shatrughna also, that valiant one is highly gladdened and entered his own city, 
indeed to the high rejoice of his father, King of Kekaya. [1-77-19b, 20a]

After the departure of Bharata, then the masterly proficient Rama along with Lakshmana started to square with the plans 
and programs of his godly father for an ideal-sovereignty. [1-77-20b, 21a]

Rama keeping his father's directives in view undertook welfare activities for the people that are agreeable and even advantageous 
to them, and in the entirety of those activities, and he undertook activities to humour motherly affection with his mothers, 
and educational activities with educators, and in a highly self-disciplined manner he used to review them carefully from 
time to time. [1-77-22b, 22, 23a]

That way Dasharatha is pleased with the deportment and comportment of Rama, likewise the Brahman-s and urbanites, and even 
all of the indwellers in the entire kingdom are pleased, and he who has high distinction, his truthfulness alone is his 
vantage point, and whose hallmarks are of higher degree, that Rama has manifested himself to those subjects in the kingdom, 
and even to all of the living beings in the world, as the Self-Created Brahma. [1-77-23b, 24, 25a]

Also, that hearty Rama who permeated into the heart of Seetha is ensconced in Seetha's heart alone, and he disported for 
many seasons along with Seetha. [1-77-25b, 26a]

Seetha has become the beloved of Rama as she is wedded with the assent of his father Dasharatha, further Rama's love for 
Seetha burgeoned by virtue of Seetha's own virtues and loveliness. [1-77-26b, 27a]

Even Rama as her husband made his mark in Seetha's heart twice as good, and they both used to clearly converse about their 
thoughts in their heart of hearts, just by their hearts. [1-77-27b, 28a]

In her mien Seetha is identical with goddesses, and she is like personified Goddess Lakshmi, thus she is the reshaped Divine 
Prosperity, and as she hails from Holy Mithila she shall be held Holy, and since she is the daughter of Janaka, a loftiest 
sagacious and invincible king, she is sagely and stately, besides being shapely, and she with all these heaps of natural 
traits and characteristics, Seetha is rejoicing the heart of Rama. [1-77-28b, c]

When passionately conjugated with such a princess from the irreproachable king Janaka, Rama, the son of sagely king Dasharatha, 
has enthusiastically shone forth like the God of Gods and the Efficient Cause, namely Vishnu, when He is together with Goddess 
Lakshmi. [1-77-29]

On the next dawn that heartened king Dasharatha who is with his teachers and his 
relatives then said this to his minister Sumantra. [1-69-1]

Now let the chancellors of exchequers draw ample riches, gems and numerous other 
items that are used in the marriage from bridegroom's side, all-inclusively, and 
let them travel in advance and let them be well-prepared for any exigency... [1-69-2]

Let the quadruple forces start off in a trice from everywhere at my order, and 
others shall start with unexcelled vehicles like palanquins, sedan chairs, litters 
etc., and with those that can be yoked with horses, like cabined-coaches and horse-carriages... 
[1-69-3]

"Vashishta, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali and Kaashyapa, and the long-lived Maarkandeya, and 
Sage Kaatyaayana... let these Brahmans travel in forefront... and let horses be 
yoked to my royal-cariole, and as the messengers of Janaka are hastening me arrange 
for the travel without time lapse..." Thus Dasharatha ordered. [1-69-4, 5]

On the word of that best king the fourfold opulence, and even the fourfold forces 
up to some extent followed rearward of the king who is going after the sages who 
are going afore of him. [1-69-6]

Travelling on a four-day-route Dasharatha reached the fringes of Videha kingdom, 
and on hearing this, the illustrious king Janaka arranged for welcome ceremonies 
at the outskirts of the city. [1-69-7]

Then the king Janaka who is by far gladdened went into a state of ecstatic elation 
when he met the senescent king and paladin of people, namely Dasharatha, as the 
pace for the marriage celebrations is quickened because of the immediate arrival 
of Dasharatha. [1-69-8]

And the best one among men, king Janaka, gleefully said this commendable sentence 
to Dasharatha, the best legatee of Raghu, "oh, king, a hearty welcome to you. Oh, 
legatee of Raghu, your arrival to my city is just by my providence... you will now 
get delectation on seeing your sons who won accolades just by their valorousness 
in the act of raising and breaking Shiva's bow..." [1-69-9, 10a]

Providentially bechanced is the arrival of this great-resplendent and godly sage 
Vashishta, who arrived here with all of these eminent Brahmans, like Indra himself 
with all gods... [1-69-10b, 11a]

Providentially my hindrances are overcome by the arrival of godlike sages, and 
providentially my lineage too is gloried owing to this hymeneal engagement with 
noble-souled Raghava-s, who are the most valorous among all the valorous people... 
[1-69-11b, 12a]

Because you are born in first and foremost Ikshvaku dynasty, hence you are the 
Indra of Indra-like kings on earth... and hence, it will be apt of you to initiate 
the celebrations of marriage tomorrow, and the marriage itself after the culmination 
of the Vedic-ritual in three or four days, and the date and time for the marriage, 
that which is agreeable to the best sages can be decided, and you can get it performed 
on that date, through those great sages... [1-69-12b, 13a]

On hearing that sentence of king Janaka the sententious king Dasharatha replied 
the king Janaka from amongst the sages. [1-69-13b, 14a]

"Recipiency rests with the restitutor..." so I have heard earlier. Hence, whatever 
you say, for you are the knower of probity and nothing goes amiss in your astute 
thinking, that we will do... [1-69-14b, 15a]

On listening that sentence of that affirmer of principles, namely Dasharatha, that 
which is conformable to the principles of marriages and familial glory, a thrill 
of joy came over the king of Videha. [1-69-15b. 16a]

Then, on the foregathering of sages from Vashishta's side with the sages of Mithila 
all the sages have attained extreme joy and they spent that night happily. [1-69-16b, 
17a]

Then that most brilliant Rama, keeping Vishvamitra ahead, and strutting in step 
with Lakshmana, strutted to touch the feet of his father Dasharatha. [1-69-17]

On seeing his two sons, the super medallists in Raghu's dynasty, King Dasharatha 
is highly rejoiced and he resided in Mithila with a high contentment, for the reverence 
of Janaka is that high. [1-69-18]

Even the great-resplendent Janaka on performing ritual acts according to scriptures 
for the Vedic-ritual on hand, and the preparatory rituals for handing out both of 
his daughters in marriage, went into the sleep of the just, with his palm on his 
chest. [1-69-19]

Then on seeing the flurrying warriors earlier created by the Sacred Cow, Shabala, who are perplexed 
by the missiles of Vishvamitra, Vashishta started to motivate her, 'oh, wish-milker, generate more forces 
by your yogic capacity.' Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration about the legend of Vishvamitra 
to Rama. [1-55-1]

"From the 'hums' of her mooing Kaamboja-s similar to sunshine are born, from her udder Pahlava-s wielding 
weaponry are born, from the area of her privates Yavana-s, likewise from her rectal area Shaka-s, and 
from her hair-roots Mleccha-s, Haariitaa-s along with Kirataka-s are issued forth. [1-55-2, 3]

At that very moment, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, Vishvamitra's army comprising foot-soldiers, elephants, 
chariots and horses is utterly slaughtered by the Yavana, Mleccha etc., forces generated by the Sacred 
Cow. [1-55-4]

On seeing their army utterly slaughtered by the vital spirit of Vashishta, a band of hundred sons of 
Vishvamitra wielding divers weapons exasperatedly sprinted forth towards that supreme meditator among 
all meditators. But that great sage Vashishta completely burnt all of them down just by blasting 'hum' 
sounds. [1-55-5, 6]

That sage with vital spirit, Vashishta, then in a wink rendered those sons of Vishvamitra, along with 
their horses, chariots, and foot-soldiers to ashes. [1-55-7]

On seeing his sons and his forces are utterly ruined, that very highly glorious Vishvamitra was disgraced 
and beset by distress. [1-55-8]

Like a tideless ocean his warfare did not tide him over, like a fangless serpent his hiss of warring 
could not fang any, like a wingless bird pitiable is his flightless plight of fightback, like a shineless 
sun in an eclipse, Vishvamitra plunged into a lustreless state of his own illustriousness, when his 
forces are ruined along with his sons. [1-55-9, 10a]

When all his intrepidity and impetuosity are ruined an indolence bechanced upon him, and then on bidding 
one son for the kingdom, 'you rule the earth with the duties of kingcraft...' thus saying Vishvamitra 
took recourse to forests. [1-55-10b, 11]

On going to the mountainsides of Himalayas, whereat it is adored by kinnaraa-s and uragaa-s, the nymphs 
and nymphean serpents, he that great practiser of ascesis, Vishvamitra, undertook an austere ascesis 
for the sake of beneficence of the Great God, Shiva. [1-55-12]

After a long lost time, Shiva, the God of Gods whose flag bears the sign of Holy Bull, has shown himself 
to that great-saint Vishvamitra, for He is a ready boon-giver. [1-55-13]

'Oh, king, for which purpose you undertook this ascesis that you may tell me. What is it really intended 
by you and what boon you seek that be made known to me for I am the boon-giver.' Shiva said so to Vishvamitra. 
[1-55-14]

Thus said by God Shiva to Vishvamitra of great ascesis, Vishvamitra on reverencing that Great God Shiva 
said this way. [1-55-15]

Oh! Mahadeva, the Impeccable Great God... providing that you are gladdened by my ascetic devotion,
<font color="#B3003A">dhanurveda</font>, the Holy Writ of Archery, with its complemental and supplemental 
Writs, and along with its summational <font color=" #B3003A">Upanishad-s</font>, together with its preternatural 
doctrines... they may kindly be bestowed upon me... [1-55-16]

' Oh, Exquisite God, whichever missile is there either with gods, or fiends, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, 
and demons, let it dawn upon me. For you alone are the God of Gods your blessings alone can fulfil my 
aspiration.' Thus Vishvamitra entreated God Shiva. [1-55-17, 18a]

'So be it!' On sanctifying Vishvamitra and his aspiration thus, the God of Gods, Shiva disappeared. 
[1-55-18b]

Vishvamitra who is already a mightier Kshatriya, now on acquiring missiles from the God of Gods, Shiva, 
will he not come forth paired up with mightiest conceit, and then will not his conceitedness be plethoric 
like a plethoric ocean? [1-55-19]

By vitality Vishvamitra is like an ocean with rough riptide on a Full Moon day, and oh, Rama, he deemed 
that sagaciously mighty sage Vashishta is now 'dead.' [1-55-20]

Then on going to the threshold of Vashishta 's hermitage that king propelled his missiles, by the holocaust 
of which missiles that ascetic woodland is completely burnt down in its entirety. [1-55-21]

On seeing the turbo-jetting missiles of Vishvamitra jetted by his sparkling intellect, hundreds of 
saints were frightened and they very speedily fled in hundreds of ways. [1-55-22]

Whoever is the disciple of Vashishta and whichever is either animal or a bird, all are utterly frightened 
and thousands of them have hastily fled to numerous directions. [1-55-23]

The threshold of that broad-minded Vashishta's hermitage fell void, and in a wink it has become silent 
like a burial ground as every shrub, herb and tree is cindery, and every bird, animal and stock is an 
evacuee. [1-55-24]

Although Vashishta shouted at them saying time and again, 'do not fear, do not fear... now I will dissipate 
that son of Gaadhi, Vishvamitra, like Sun demisting the mist,' all the inmates of hermitage have hastily 
fled. [1-55-25]

On saying that way to the evacuees, Vashishta, the great-resplendent sage and a best one among best 
meditators rancorously said this word to Vishvamitra. [1-55-26]

You senseless king, by which reason you have havocked this hermitage that is well nourished for a 
long time by me, for that reason you have become a reprehensible one, and thereby you will not survive 
any longer. [1-55-27]

"On saying thus that extremely infuriated Sage Vashishta post-hastily up-heaved his baton, which is 
alike the fumeless Ultimate Fire of End Time, and the other baton of Yama, the Terminator, and affronted 
Vishvamitra." Thus, Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-55-28]

The godly saint Valmiki composed Ramayana on Rama's retrieving kingdom, wording admirably 
and meaningfully. [1-4-1]

Sage Valmiki said Ramayana in twenty four thousand verses, in five hundred chapters, in six 
books, likewise an end-piece too. [1-4-2]

Though that great scholar composed thus with leading and sequel legends, that godly saint 
thought over thus 'really, who will render all this ballad...' [1-4-3]

Then Lava and Kusha who are in the attire of hermits have touched the feet of that contemplative 
soul Valmiki, who is now thoughtful. [1-4-4]

Glorious Kusha and Lava are the virtue knowing princes, and they are endowed with melodious 
voice, besides being the residents of the same hermitage, thus Valmiki saw them saluting at 
his feet. [1-4-5]

On seeing that pair intellectuals who are proficient in Veda-s that self-reliant sage Valmiki 
made those two to memorize the epic, as the epic Ramayana is composed only to reinforce the 
import of Veda-s, as an ancillary. [1-4-6]

That sage with observed sacred vows has rendered the entire epic in the name of 'Ramayana', 
'Sublime Legend of Seetha' and 'elimination of Ravana'. [1-4-7]

To read or to sing it is melodious, adaptable to music with three scales and sevenfold tune, 
and orchestral to the tunes of string-instrument and rhythm included... [1-4-8]

Aesthetics like romance, pathos, comic, fury, fright, valour etc., embodying the epic is sung 
[by Kusha, Lava.] [1-4-9]

They are conversant with the art of music and proficient with the pitch and pausing their 
voices, and those two brothers have not only a wealthy voice, but they also look like celestial 
singers. [1-4-10]

They have charm in their appearance and melodiousness in their voice, they are like the two 
reflections of one original object, and thus they came out from the body of Rama, separately. 
[1-4-11]

They the princes have memorized that virtue-expounding epic, the best; in its entirety and 
in doing so, they rendered that epic faultlessly. [1-4-12]

They sung the epic as schooled, well aware of its content and intent, among the assemblages 
of sages, scholars and also of eminent persons, with their best concentration [1-4-13]

Once those two great-souls who endowed with musical talent and with all remarkable features, 
sung this epic, standing nearby the midst of a gathering of sages and pious souls. [1-4-14]

On hearing that, the eyes of all the sages were overspread with tears of happiness, and they 
appreciated saying, 'splendid, splendid is this...' [1-4-15]

All those saints being the saint-patrons of virtue are pleased at heart, and praised the praiseworthy 
Kusha and Lava, while they are singing. [1-4-16]

"The melody of the ballad, especially the meaning of verses, aha! Superb... though this has 
happened long-ago it is shown like the one happening presently... [1-4-17]

"On getting into the mood of the epic, those two sang its import in one tune, that too melodiously 
and rapturously, marinating the pitch and tune..." So said the saints. [1-4-18]

While the great saints of blessed ascesis are appreciating that way, those two melodiously 
sang very effectually and very meaningfully. [1-4-19]

And someone, a pleased saint, got up and bestowed a handy vessel to them... another reputed 
sage, lauding them contributed a jute robe. [1-4-20]

And another sage bestowed a black-deerskin, and like that yet another a sacred thread... someone 
gave a water-pot and another great saint a girdle of maunja grass to singers, while that way 
another contributed an under cloth; another sage gladly contributed a hatchet to them, another 
a saffron clothe, and yet another saint bestowed a cloth-wrapper; another delivered tuft-headband 
also, and another enchanted for their singing ballad handed out a sacrificial vessel, and 
another a bundle of firewood sticks, and yet another gave a plank-seat of audambari wood, 
and other called forth blessings, and someone then happily chanted bless-hymns for longevity... 
there by all the truth-avowing saints, those that are great sages have thus bestowed boons. 
[1-4-21-26]

"Surprising is this well-said rendering of Valmiki... it is the subsistence for tomorrow's 
poets... and this is completed sequentially, as well... [1-4-26]

While this song that generates longevity and prosperity, and one that is melodious one to 
all ears is being sung everywhere in streets and king's ways and while those two singers who 
are experts in singing any kind of music are being appreciated everywhere, Rama has seen them. 
[1-4-27-28]

Then on seeing them Rama, the enemy-eliminator, fetched those honour-worthy bothers, Lava 
and Kusha, to his palace and honoured them. [1-4-29]

He that king Rama is then surrounded by his ministers and brothers that are sitting his nearby, 
he himself sat on a divine golden throne. [1-4-30]

Having seen the mannerly brothers endowed with beautiful features, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, 
and Shatrughna, and Bharata likewise. [1-4-31]

Rama said to thus, "Let this ballad be keenly heard from these divinely resplendent brothers, 
for it contains versatile words and meanings...' and thus he motivated the singers. [1-4-32]

Even those two singers have sung the ballad melodiously and effectually, with their clear 
and clarified voices, like the melody of string and rhythmic instruments, with very clear 
and meaningful intonation. [1-4-33]

Enthralling courtier's bodies, minds and hearts also, and thus that song shone forth as it 
is for all ears, bearing a comfort in its manifestation, among the gathering of the people. 
[1-4-34]

"These two saint-like Kusha and Lava, who also possess kingly features, but they are great 
hermits... this narration is endowing good fortune to me also, listen to that great efficacious 
legend [of Seetha...]" [So said Rama to those courtiers.] [1-4-35]

Then those two singers, motivated by Rama's words, sang the ballad in maarga system, for they 
are well versed in it, then even Rama, who is also in the congregation, again to pacify his 
mind, [for the story of Seetha puts his mind to turmoil,] became interested at heart [to continue 
listening Seetha's story...] [1-4-36]

"That great-saint Vishvamitra then leaving off the snowbound Himalayas on north, 
oh, Rama, he reached eastern quarter and undertook rigorous ascesis." Thus Sage 
Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-65-1]

Committing himself to a vow of muteness, oh, Rama, he performed an unexcelled and 
unmatched ascesis which is highly impracticable for others to perform. [1-65-2]

Even on completing a thousand years, even when that great-saint became woodenly, 
even many barriers are at full blast, oh, Rama, fury has not entered his heart of 
hearts, for he stood fast in an unmitigated ascesis on making a firm determination. 
[1-65-3, 4a]

On one day when those thousand years of ascesis with the rigorous pledge of Vishvamitra 
are being completed, and when he started to eat his meal, oh, Rama, best of Raghu's 
dynasty, Indra arrived there disguising himself as a Brahman and requested for the 
readily available meal. [1-65-4b, 5]

Then that godly Vishvamitra willingly gave away all the readied meal to that Brahman, 
and as no meal is leftover by Brahman-Indra, that great-ascetic Vishvamitra starved 
himself. Vishvamitra did not speak a little to the Brahman in dissent as he is abided 
by his pledge of muteness, and he again remained in muteness and breath-control. 
Like that, he indeed carried on his ascesis. [1-65-6, 7]

That eminent saint remained without respiration for another thousand years, and 
then fumes have started to emit from the head of sage who is controlling his breath, 
by which fumes the triad of worlds looked as if it is searing, and this startled 
all the worlds. [1-65-8, 9a]

Then the gods, sages, gandharva-s, serpents, reptiles, demons are puzzled at the 
ascesis of Vishvamitra, and as their own resplendence is dulled by the ascesis of 
Vishvamitra, thereby they are marred by this blemish of lowered resplendence, then 
all of them addressed the Grandparent, Brahma. [1-65-9b, 10]

Even if that great-saint Vishvamitra is angered and allured in order to foil 
his ascetical ascendancy, by all of us and by all means oh, god, he is transcending 
these lures, angers, and passions by his ascesis. [1-65-11]

Now, even an imperceptible imperfection does not really appear in him, but if 
his heartfelt desire is not meted out, he will devastate the triad of worlds with 
his ascetic power. [1-65-12, 13a]

All the directions are all tumultuous, all the oceans are tempestuous, and all 
the mountains are eruptive, and nothing is bright. [1-65-13b, 14a]

The earth is highly tremulous, air is gusting turbulently, oh, Brahma, people 
tend to become non-theistic and we do not know what to do. [1-65-14b, 15a]

All the beings in the triad of the worlds are very highly perturbed at their 
senses and they are as though stupefied, and when juxtaposed the sun is lustreless 
before the resplendence of that great sage. [1-65-15b, 16a]

Oh, God, great saint Vishvamitra turned out to be the embodiment of Fire-god, 
and before that great-resplendent and most reverential sage makes up his mind for 
total destruction of all worlds he is to be placated. [1-65-16b, 17a]

'As to how the End-Time Fire entirely blazed away the triad of worlds previously, 
now this sage may do likewise, hence whatever is his predilection that may be given 
to him, even if he wants to become the potentate on the realm of gods.' Thus, all 
gods appealed to Brahma [1-65-17b, 18a]

Then all the assemblages of gods keeping the Grandparent Brahma in their forefront 
appeared before that great souled Vishvamitra and said this harmonious word. [1-65-18b, 
19a]

Oh, Brahma-sage, you are welcome. We are much contented with your ascesis. Oh, 
Kaushika, you have achieved Bahaman-hood by your rigorous ascesis. [1-65-19b, 20a]

'Along with the assemblages of Marut-Wind-gods, I bestow upon you a long life. 
Let blissfulness betide you. You be safe. Oh, gentle sage, you may take leave as 
you please.' Thus, Brahma said to Vishvamitra. [1-65-20b, 21a]

On hearing the word of Grandparent Brahma and the other residents of heaven, and 
on paying good devoirs to all of them that great saint cheerfully said. [1-65-21b, 
22a]

If Brahman-hood and eternality have befallen on me, let the quintessence of AUM 
and vaSat syllables, and even all Veda-s patronise me. [1-65-22b, 23a]

'Oh, gods, he who is the outstanding one among the geniuses of kingcraft, and 
among the scholars of Veda-s as well, even that Vashishta, the brainchild of Brahma, 
shall acknowledge me in this way as Brahma-sage. Oh, the best gods, you may take 
leave if you can effectuate this ultimate yearning of mine.' Thus Vishvamitra requested 
the gods. [1-65-23b, 24]

Then the best one among meditators Vashishta has come over there when the gods 
besought him to come, and he made friendship with Vishvamitra. He also said in this 
way to Vishvamitra, 'you are a Brahma-sage.' [1-65-25]

'No doubt, you are a Brahma-sage and everything will accrue to you in accordance 
with the sublimity of this sageship,' and when Vashishta said so to Vishvamitra, 
all the gods have gone away as they have come. [1-65-26]

On getting his Brahman-hood even the virtue-souled Vishvamitra started to reverence 
the supreme among meditators and his counterpart Brahma-sage, namely Vashishta. 
[1-65-27]

When his aim is effectuated Vishvamitra ambled all over the earth abiding in ascesis, 
and oh, Rama, this great souled sage Vishvamitra achieved Brahman-hood in this way. 
[1-65-28]

"Oh, Rama, he is the best saint, he is the embodiment of ascesis, he is always obliged 
with righteousness, and he is the stronghold for fortitude." [1-65-29]

On narrating the legend of Vishvamitra in this way that best Brahman and great-resplendent 
Sage Shataananda took respite. And on listening the narration of Sage Shataananda 
said in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, king Janaka said this sentence to Kushika's 
son, Vishvamitra, with suppliantly adjoined palms. [1-65-30b, 31a]

Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, you happened to be here at this Vedic-ritual which 
is conducted by me, oh, Kaushika, that too, along with Rama and Lakshmana, the legatees 
of Kakutstha, thereby I am fortunate, I am much obliged. [31b, 32a]

Oh, Brahman, I stand consecrated just by your graceful glance, and oh, great saint, 
I reckon that I have achieved many boons just glancing at you. [1-65-32b, 33a]

Oh, great-resplendent Brahman, myself and the noble souled Rama have heard about 
your great ascesis when Sage Shataananda extolled it comprehensively. [1-65-33b, 
34a]

The congregationalists available in this Vedic-ritual congregation have also heard 
about your numerous endowments. Inestimable is your ascesis, infinite is your power, 
and oh, son of Kushika, your talents are everlastingly invaluable. [1-65-34b, 35]

Oh, lord, there is no contentment to me while listening to your wondrous narratives, 
but oh nobleman, time for vespertine ritual is fast approaching as sun's sphere 
is dangling westward. [1-65-36]

"Oh, great-resplendent sage, it will be apt of you to see me tomorrow. Oh, best 
meditator, it will be apt of you to permit me to leave for now." Thus Janaka sought 
leave from Vishvamitra. [1-65-37]

When he is spoken in that way, the best saint Vishvamitra is pleased at heart, and 
praising Janaka, who too is pleased to meet the sage, immediately bid farewell to 
the best one among men, namely Janaka. [1-65-38]

This way on saying to the best saint, the king of Mithila and the legatee of Videha 
lineage, immediately performed circumambulations along with his teachers and relatives 
to Vishvamitra in veneration. [1-65-39]

Even that virtue souled Vishvamitra started towards his own camp along with Rama 
and Lakshmana, while being venerated by great sages who are available in the ritual-hall.

			When that matchlessly illustrious Rama has asked for details, that highly 
			resplendent sage Vishvamitra started to narrate about that forest to 
			Rama. [1-29-1]

			"Here, oh, dextrous Rama, he who is worshipped by gods and who has got 
			outstanding ascesis that Vishnu resided here in the pursuit of practising 
			ascesis and yoga for good many years, likewise for a hundred eras. [1-29-2, 
			3a]

			"This is the erstwhile hermitage of great-souled Vaamana renowned as 
			Accomplished hermitage, why because the sage with supreme ascesis Kaashyapa 
			got accomplishment to such of his ascesis there only. [1-29-3b, 4a]

			"In the meantime, when Vishnu was in his asceticism in this hermitage, 
			the son of King Virochana, namely Bali, has completely conquered all 
			the assemblages of gods together with Indra and his coterie called Wind-gods, 
			and ruling that kingdom where that hermitage is there, he has become 
			renowned in all the three worlds for his magnanimity. [1-29-4b, 5]

			"That great mighty chief of demons Bali then conducted a very grand 
			Vedic ritual. But when Bali is conducting that ritual remaining as its 
			officiator all the gods personally approached Vishnu, keeping Fire-god 
			ahead of them, just here in this hermitage and they spoke to him. [1-29-6]

			" 'Oh, all-pervading god Vishnu, Bali the son of Virochana is conducting 
			an unsurpassed Vedic ritual, before the completion of which our own 
			mission, say the task of gods, is to be achieved completely. [1-29-7]

			" 'Whoever the supplicant might be and from wherever he might be coming, 
			but if one approaches and supplicates to him he is donating that in 
			as is where is condition, whatever is supplicated and wherever it might 
			be. [1-29-8]

			" 'As such, oh, Vishnu, you may effectuate the most suitable merited 
			deed for the welfare of gods on resorting to your illusory power, Vishnu 
			Maya, and on assuming the form of a dwarf to deal with Emperor Bali.' 
			Thus gods appealed to Vishnu. [1-29-9]

			"In the meanwhile, oh Rama, he whose brilliance is similar to ritual 
			fire, who will be with his wife Lady Aditi, who is resplendent with 
			his own vitality, that godly sage Kaashyapa on completing his asceticism 
			along with Lady Aditi started to eulogise the boon giver and the eliminator 
			of demon Madhu, namely Vishnu." Thus Vishvamitra is narrating to Rama. 
			[1-29-10, 11]

			" 'Oh, Supreme Person, you are abounding with asceticism, aggregate 
			of asceticism, the aspect of asceticism, and the very soul of asceticism, 
			such as you are, I am able to see you with the well practised asceticism 
			of mine. [1-29-12]

			" 'In your physique I am seeing this entire universe, oh, god, and you 
			are without a beginning and indefinable, and in you I am taking shelter.' 
			Sage Kaashyapa praised Vishnu in this way. [1-29-13]

			Vishnu is gladdened for the devotion of sage Kaashyapa who is absolved 
			of any blemish in his ascesis, and then Vishnu said this to, "You may 
			seek a boon as you are boon-worthy, I opine that you are a preferred 
			one to me, let safety be with you." Thus Vishnu said to Kaashyapa. [1-29-14]

			On hearing the word of Vishnu sage Kaashyapa, the son of Sage Mariicha 
			said, "oh, god the accorder of boons, as you are pleased with us it 
			will be apt of you to bestow the boon besought by Lady Aditi and the 
			gods, oh, lord with lofty vows, for which boon I am also supplicating 
			to you, following them. [1-29-15, 16a]

			" 'Oh, god, oh, sinless one, you may please attain the sonship of Lady 
			Aditi and myself, oh, dispenser of demons, it will be apt of you to 
			render help to gods who are agonised in the anguish owing to the predominance 
			of Emperor Bali, by becoming the younger brother of Indra. [1-29-16b, 
			17]

			" 'Oh, god of gods, as the works of my austerities are accomplished 
            here, by your grace this hermitage will be renowned by the name Siddhaashram, 
            Hermitage of Accomplishment, hence oh god, arise from here to 
			become my son.' So said sage Kaashyapa to Vishnu. [1-29-18]

			"That great resplendent Vishnu then adopting a semblance of a dwarf 
			emerged from Aditi, and that dwarfish ascetic boy approached Emperor 
			Bali, the son of Virochana." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. [1-29-19]

			"That dwarf ascetic boy Vaamana begged and received a space that can 
			be covered in three strides, but strode all the three worlds in those 
			three steps for the purpose of saving worlds, as he is interested in 
			the welfare of all the worlds. Vishnu gave the earth back to Indra restraining 
			Emperor Bali with his vitality. Thus that great resplendent Vishnu made 
			the three worlds to come under the control of Indra again. [1-29-20, 
			21]

			"This hermitage which at one time is presided by Vishnu, is an eradicator 
			of stress, either the stress and strain caused by the evil on earth, 
			or the stress of going through the cycle of birth and death, thus this 
			hermitage is an accorded of salvation, and I am also beneficed with 
			this hermitage owing to my devotion to Vaamana. [1-29-22]

			"Demons causing obstacles, oh, tigerly man Rama, will be arriving at 
			that hermitage and there alone those demons with evil pursuit are to 
			be eliminated. [1-29-23]

			"Rama, we now go to the unexcelled hermitage of Accomplishment, oh, 
			dear one, as to how this hermitage belongs to me, this also belongs 
			to you." Thus Vishvamitra said to Rama. [1-29-24]

			So saying that great sage Vishvamitra is highly gladdened to lead Rama 
			together with Lakshmana to the hermitage, and on his entering the hermitage 
			with those two, that sage shone forth like moon with a two starred constellation 
			called Punarvasu, the fifth or seventh lunar mansion, after dispersal 
			of mist. [1-29-25]

			On seeing the arrival of Vishvamitra all of the resident sages of Accomplished 
			Hermitage have quickly approached him with hustle and bustle adoring 
			him. [1-29-26]

			Those sages reverenced Vishvamitra according to their deservedness, 
			likewise they have offered hospitality to both of the princes, Rama 
			and Lakshmana. [1-29-27]

			Those two princes from Raghu's dynasty and the enemy-subjugators, namely 
			Rama and Lakshmana, briefly took rest and adjoining palms they spoke 
			to the sagely tiger Vishvamitra. [1-29-28]

			"Oh, the eminent sage, today itself you may undertake the ritual of 
			solemnity that is undertaken prior to the main ritual, be safe, and 
			let this Hermitage of Accomplishment become an accomplished one in eradiating 
			vice true to its name, and let the word of yours given to my father 
			in fetching me to this place come true." So said Rama to Vishvamitra, 
			supported by Lakshmana. [1-29-29]

			When he is said so, that great radiant and supreme sage Vishvamitra, 
			thereupon scrupulously undertook the vow of ritual controlling his senses. 
			[1-29-30]

			Both the youngsters Rama and Lakshmana on spending that night vigilantly 
			got up with the sunrise. On finishing morning time bathing they meditated 
			upon the easterly aurora, and then on completing the supreme meditation 
			on Gayatri in its regularity, they addressed themselves to sage Vishvamitra, 
			who by now has enkindled ritual fire and sitting before the Altar of 
			Fire. [1-29-31, 32]

On the competition of the horse ritual of high-souled Dasharatha, the golds having received 
their portion of sacrificial oblation returned to their abodes as they have come. [1-18-1]

The king completing his consecratory vows held for horse ritual, entered Ayodhya city along 
with the company of his queens, servants, guards and vehicles. [1-18-2]

The other kings who arrived for the ritual are delighted when befittingly honoured by the 
king Dasharatha, and they too returned to their countries, after suitably adoring the eminent 
sage Vashishta. [1-18-3]

The entourages of those kings who set forth homeward from that city are highly gladdened and 
shone forth in fine fettle. [1-18-4]

On the departure of visiting kings, then that fortunate king Dasharatha entered the city Ayodhya, 
keeping eminent Brahman priests ahead of him in the procession. [1-18-5]

Well adored by king Dasharatha sage Rishyasringa also travelled along with his wife Shanta, 
followed by his father-in-law King Romapada, and along with other co-travellers, namely the 
entourage of Romapada. [1-18-6]

On dispersing all of them king Dasharatha gratifyingly dwelled there in Ayodhya, with a satiated 
heart dwelling upon the birth of his sons. [1-18-7]

On completion of the ritual, six seasons have passed by; then in the twelfth month, i.e., 
in <em>chaitra-mAsa</em>, and on the ninth day of that <em>chaitra</em> month [April-May], 
when it is <em>punarvasunakShatrayukta-navamI tithi</em>, i.e., when the ruling star of that 
ninth day is <em>punarvasu,</em> 
for which Aditi is the presiding deity; and when five of the nine planets - <em>sUrya, kuja, guru, 
shukra, shani </em>are in<em> ucChasthAna</em>-s, namely, when those planets are in 
ascension in their respective houses - <em>meSha, makara, karkaTa, mIna, tula - rAshI</em>-s; and when <em>chandrayukta- 
guru, karkaTalagne</em> - Jupiter in conjuction with Moon is ascendant in Cancer, and when day is advancing, 
Queen Kausalya gave birth to a son with all the divine attributes like lotus-red eyes, 
lengthy arms, roseate lips, voice like drumbeat, and who took birth to delight the Ikshwaku 
dynasty and adored by all the worlds, and who is the greatly blessed epitome of Vishnu, 
namely Rama. [1-18-8, 9, 10, 11]

Twice six months had rolled a way since the great sacrifice was over and, in the first month 
of the New Year, on the ninth day of the bright fortnight, the Lord of the worlds chose to 
take human form and sent down half of His essence as the son of Kausalya (thenceforth to be 
known as Rama), the world-honored One, the crowning glory of the grand line of Ikshwku, and 
the sum of all perfections. The constellation Punarvasu, of which Aditi was the regent, was 
chosen to preside at his birth. The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn were in ascension 
in their respective houses. Aries, Capricornus, Cancer, Pisces and the Libra, Jupiter and 
the Moon were in conjunction ; the rising sign was Cancer. And KausalyA, shone with unparalleled 
effulgence, even as Aditi when she gave birth to Indra, the lord of the Shining Ones, the 
Vajra-wielder. - C. R. Sreeniuasa Aiyangar, 1910.

Kausalya shone forth with such a son whose resplendence is unlimited, as with lady Aditi who 
once stood out with her son Indra, the best one among gods. [1-18-12]

Queen Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharata, one embodied with all merits, and whose truthfulness 
itself is his valour and who is fourth component of manifest Vishnu, namely Rama. [1-18-13]

Queen Sumitra then gave birth to two sons who are the embodied epitomes of Vishnu, namely 
Lakshmana, and Shatrughna, who are valiant ones and experts in all kinds of weaponry. [1-18-14]

			With the dawn of sun on the next day, fair-minded Bharata is born under Pisces where <em>puSyami</em> 
			is the star of day, later the sons of Sumitra, namely Lakshmana and Shatrughna are 
			born under Cancer, where <em>aashleSa</em> is the star of the 
			day, i.e., the tenth of chaitra month, [1-18-15]

Thus there are four great-souled sons of Dasharatha, born on separate instances, who are virtuous, 
charming, and by brilliance they are in similitude with two stars of each of the asterisms 
called <font color="#B3003A">puurvaabhaadra</font> and <font color="#B3003A">uttaraabhaadra</font>. 
[1-18-16]

The celestial singers sang melodiously, paradisiacal dancing parties danced, divine drums 
drummed and heavens rained flowers, with all this there is a great festivity in Ayodhya with 
thronging people. [1-18-17, 18a]

Hilarity filled the streets with people stampeding them and with the flurry of actors, dancers, 
singers and instrumentalists, as well by other onlookers, and there on the streets widely 
strewn are all kinds of gems appreciating the artists. [1-18-18b, 19]

The king gave worthy gifts to eulogisers, bard singers, and panegyrists, and to Brahmans he 
gave funds and wealth in the form of thousands of cows. [1-18-20]

Elapsed are eleven days and the naming ceremony is performed, then Vashishta, the chief priest, 
named the high-souled elder one as Rama, Kaikeyi's son as Bharata, and one son of Sumitra 
as Lakshmana and the other as Shatrughna [1-18-21, 22]

The king feasted Brahmans, urbanites and villagers and he gifted many valuable gems to Brahmans 
in an unlimited way, and all the rituals of birth and ceremonies sequel to it like naming 
ceremony, first-food-feeding ceremony, first-hair-removal ceremony, and sacred thread ceremony 
are performed in respect of the princes. [1-18-23, 24a]

Among those princes the eldest one Rama is like a flagstaff and a delight of his father Dasharatha, 
and he became acceptable to all beings like the self-created Brahma. [1-18-24b, 25a]

All the princes are scholars in Veda-s, valiant ones, all are interested in the welfare of 
the world, all are intellectuals and all of them possess an air of probity. [1-18-25b, 26a]

Among them the great resplendent Rama, whose valour itself is his truthfulness, is the dear 
one to all the world like the tranquil moon. [1-18-26b, 27a]

Rama is admittedly a champion of riding elephants and horses, also in tactical charioting, 
and he rejoices in the art of archery, and absorbed in the obedient service of his father. 
[1-18-27b, 28a]

Right from childhood Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, is always amiable towards his 
world-charming elder brother Rama. [1-18-28b, 29a]

Lakshmana who is endowed with the wealth of dedication dedicated himself to Rama with bodily 
service, and while performing all agreeable deeds in respect of Rama, he behaved like Rama's 
alter ego. [1-18-29b, 30a]

That best one among the men Rama does not get his sleep without Lakshmana and he would 
not eat food brought for him, however delicious it may be, without Lakshmana. [1-18-30b, 31a]

Whenever Raghava mounts a horse and goes on a hunting game Lakshmana rushes after him wielding 
his bow as a squire. [1-18-31b, 32a]

Lakshmana's younger brother Shatrughna is a dear one to Bharata, like that Bharata too held 
Shatrughna dearer than his own lives. [1-18-32b, 33a]

King Dasharatha is highly gladdened with four of his highly fortunate sons like the Forefather 
Brahma with gods in heaven. [1-18-33]

When all of the four sons are thus prospering with prudence, gifted with all the merits, self-conscious 
to do wrong deeds, well-known for their gentility, knowers of pros and cons and even the conscientious 
princes, then their father Dasharatha is contented in respect of all of them who are such 
radiantly brilliant and potential princes, like Brahma. [1-18-34b, 35, 36a]

Even those tigerly-men, namely the princes, are engrossed in the studies of Veda-s, delighted 
to render service to their father and they are also the experts in art of archery. [1-18-36b, 
37a]

Then the noble souled Dasharatha contemplated along with his priestly teachers and relatives 
about the matrimonial alliances of his sons. [1-18-37b, 38a]

While the great souled Dasharatha is discussing the marriages of princes among his ministers, 
the highly powerful sage Vishvamitra arrived. [1-18-38b, 39a]

Desirous to have an audience with king Vishvamitra said to the doorkeeper, "Let the king be 
informed quickly that I, the son of Gadhi from the dynasty of Kushi, have come" [1-18-39b, 
40a]

On listening those words all the doorkeepers are dumbfounded, and ushered by those words they 
quickly rushed to the place of Dasharatha. [1-18-40b, 41a]

Then on their arriving at the king's palace the doorkeepers have announced to the king of 
Ikshvaku-s, namely Dasharatha, about the arrival of sage Vishvamitra. [1-18-41b, 42a]

On hearing that message from doorkeepers Dasharatha is highly pleased and he has gone towards 
Vishvamitra in a self-possessed manner along with royal priests, as Indra would ceremoniously 
go towards Brahma. [1-18-42b, 43a]

Then on seeing the resplendent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance is by his own ascesis and 
who has severe self-discipline, the king offered water with a gladsome aspect, as first customary 
hospitality in receiving unexpected guest. [1-18-43b, 44a]

On receiving water from the king scripturally and customarily Vishvamitra enquired after the 
well-being and welfare of king Dasharatha. [1-18-44b, 45a]

That highly righteous sage Vishvamitra asked the king after the well-being of city, exchequer, 
rural areas, friends and relatives. [1-18-45b, 46a]

Sage Vishvamitra asked Dasharatha, "Are all of the provincial kings acquiescent to you, and 
all your enemies conquered? Are you properly performing the devotional and social works?" 
[1-18-46b, 47a]

And on meeting the eminent sage Vashishta and with them the other exalted sages according 
to custom Vishvamitra asked after their well-being. [1-18-47b, 48a]

Then adoringly invited by the king Dasharatha all of them gladly entered the palace and they 
took their seats according to protocol. [1-18-48b, 49a]

Then the very generous king Dasharatha is gladdened at heart at the arrival of Vishvamitra, 
and he spoke this way feeling happy to adore that sage. [1-18-49b, 50a]

"I deem your arrival is in the vein of mortals attaining ambrosia, rainfall in a droughty 
land, a barren father begetting a son through his deserving wife, a regain of long lost treasures, 
and the gladness at a great happening, oh, great saint, welcome to you." [1-18-50b, 51, 52a]

"Oh, Brahman, as I am the one who is delighted for your arrival, and as you are the most eligible 
recipient from me, what is that choicest object of yours to be fulfilled by me, and in which 
way. Oh, endower of respect, for me your arrival is fortunate whereby my birth is fructified 
and my life flourished today, and wherefore I could see a great Brahman like you visiting 
my home, therefore the sun appears to have dawned in my night. [1-18-52b, 53, 54a]

"Originally your glory was explicit by your title kingly-sage, and subsequently you 
attained the Absolute-sainthood by your ascesis, and you are venerable to me, in many 
ways." [1-18-54b, 55a]

"Oh, Brahman, thereby your arrival at my place is surprising and ideally sacred to me, and 
by your very appearance I have become one who has gone on a quiet pilgrimage. [1-18-55b, 56a]

"You may tell me, entreating which work your arrival chanced here and I feel that I am indeed 
blessed and wish to make it happen to achieve results. [1-18-56b, 57a]

"It is unapt of you to deliberate about the feasibility of the work, oh, sage with blest vows, 
while I am the fulfiller of it without any reminder, since you are god to me, indeed. [1-18-57b, 
58a]

"Oh, Brahman, this is the great prosperity that bechanced on me, and this is propriety in 
its entirety that bechanced on me, as a result of your arrival. [1-18-58b, c]

On hearing the words of high-minded Dasharatha, said that way in all his humbleness, and those 
that are pleasant to ears as well to heart, he who is a renowned for his personal attributes 
and a reputed one by his exceptional qualities, that sublime sage Vishvamitra obtained high 
rejoice. [1-18-59]

Then on performing morning time rites in the aurora of next morning, king Janaka 
invited great souled Vishvamitra, along with Raghava-s. [1-66-1]

On reverencing Vishvamitra and the noble souled Raghava-s according to the formalities 
envisaged by scriptures, then the virtue souled Janaka spoke these words, indeed. 
[1-66-2]

Oh, god, you are welcome, oh, holy sage, bid me as to what I should for you, for 
I am biddable by you, indeed... [1-66-3]

When said thus by the foreseer Janaka, [who can foresee as to why Vishvamitra came 
with Raghava-s this far, and thus asked him as to what next is to be done,] that 
sage Vishvamitra, for he is presager and wordsmith, [and who knows what is to be 
done next,] said these words in reply to that valiant king Janaka. [1-66-4]

These two are the sons of Dasharatha, well-renowned Kshatriya-s in world, and they 
are desirous to see that marvellous bow which has a place with you... [1-66-5]

You may show that bow, well bodes you, and on beholding that bow the desire of 
these two princes will come true, and they will go back as they like... [1-66-6]

But Janaka replied the great sage Vishvamitra when he was addressed thus, "I shall 
[firstly] tell by which reason that bow has its place here... [1-66-7]

Oh, godly sage, there was a king renowned as Devaraata, sixth one from Nimi, [the 
originator of our lineage,] and this bow was handed down to him for custodial care 
by the Sublime Soul, Shiva... [1-66-8]

Once, during the devastation of the Vedic-ritual of Daksha Prajapati, the mettlesome 
god Rudra, rancorously outstretching the bowstring of this bow, said this to all 
gods, superciliously... [1-66-9]

'Oh, gods, whereby you have not apportioned my portion [of oblations in Vedic-ritual 
s, as I am also the] desirer of such portion, [thereby] I will shred the highly 
revered heads of yours with this bow...' [So said Shiva to gods.] [1-66-10]

Then, oh, best saint Vishvamitra, all gods are truly dismayed, and on their supplicating, 
Bhava, namely Shiva, the God of Gods is gladdened... [1-66-11]

And that Sublime Soul Shiva gladly gave that bow to all of the great souled gods, 
and oh, godly saint, then those great souled gods gave this gem of a bow of Shiva, 
the God of Gods, to our ancestor [Devaraata,] for custodial care... [1-66-12, 13a]

Later, when I was ploughing the ritual field then raised by the plough [from the 
furrow is a baby girl... since she is] gained while consecrating the ritual-field, 
she is named as Seetha, and thus she is renowned... [1-66-13b, 14a]

Hers is a non-uterine birth as she surfaced from the surface of the earth, but 
fostered as my own soul-born girl and I determined [to give her in marriage to 
a bridegroom where his] boldness is the only bounty, [I receive in that marriage...] 
[1-66-14b, 15a]

Oh, eminent sage, as my daughter has surfaced from the surface of earth and has 
come of age, the kings, [having heard my declaration that the bounty for Seetha 
is boldness alone,] have come and besought for her... [1-66-15b, 16a]

To all of those kings who are beseeching for the girl, I have not given my daughter, 
saying that she will be given for a bounty of boldness... [1-6-16b, 17a]

Then all the kings convoked and on arriving at Mithila, then they wanted to ascertain 
the calibre [of the bow, vis-a-vis their own...] [1-66-17b, 18a]

For them, those who wanted to ascertain the calibre of the bow, that bow of Shiva 
is fetched to their proximity, but they are incapable to joggle it, or even to catch 
hold of it... [1-66-18b, 19a]

Oh, great saint, on knowing the valour of those valorous ones as valueless, I countermanded 
them... oh, ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra, by that you may know [the sequel of 
it...] [1-66-19b, 20a]

Then, oh, eminent sage, those kings beleaguered Mithila in a blind fury, since 
a self-mistrust bechanced among them all, about their own valour... [1-66-20b, 21a]

They surmised for themselves that they are brushed off by me, and they possessed 
by a high rancour, they strangled the City of Mithila... [1-66-21b, 22a]

Then elapsed is an year and in anyway the possessions for livelihood went into 
a decline, oh, eminent sage, thereby I am highly anguished [1-66-22b, 23a]

Then I have assuaged the assemblages of gods by my ascesis and gods are also highly 
gladdened and gave me fourfold forces... [1-66-23b, 24a]

Then those evildoers and self-mistrustful kings while being drubbed [by the heaven-sent 
army, they have become] vigourless and broken, and they beat a hasty retreat... 
[1-66-24b, 25a]

Oh, tigerly sage this is that supremely radiant bow, and oh, saint of sacred vows, 
I will show it, even to Rama and Lakshmana... [1-66-25b, 26a]

"If Rama strings the bowstring of that bow, oh, sage, I will offer my daughter, 
whose birth is non-uterine, to Dasharatha's Rama..." [So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.] 
[1-66-26b, c]

Oh, valiant Rama of Dasharatha, your valour is bruited as a sensational valour, and sensational is your smashing of Shiva's 
bow, also thus I have thoroughly heard about your others deeds like elimination of Tataka et cetera... [1-75-1]

That way, smashing of that particular bow of Shiva is wondrous and even unimaginable... on hearing that alone I happened 
upon you, bringing another outranking bow... [1-75-2]

This alone is that catastrophic bow received through Sage Jamadagni... flex it with an arrow on bowstring stretching up 
to your ear, and in that way show your capability... [1-75-3]

"Thereby, on examining your strength in your taking aim with this bow, and should you be deservedly valorous, I will give 
you a combative duel..." So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. [1-75-4]

On hearing that sentence of Bhaargava Rama, then king Dasharatha became a pitiable one, and with a downcast face and adjoined 
palms said this. [1-75-5]

Aren't you a Brahman with inviolable ascesis, and whose rancour on Kshatriya-s has calmed down long back. Why this hostility 
again. It'll be apt of you to award aegis to my sons, for they are yet youngsters... [1-75-6]

Aren't you from the bloodline of Bhaargava-s who always conduct themselves in self-study of Vedas and self-principled ways... 
haven't you readily discarded weapon-wielding on your promise to Thousand-eyed Indra... [1-75-7]

Such as you were, you on becoming a dedicatee to probity, haven't you given the planet earth to Kashyapa and haven't you 
repaired to forests, and haven't you flagged yourself on Mt. Mahendra... [1-75-8]

"Or, oh, insurmountable sage, have you chanced upon us for a total annihilation of ours... when Rama is singularised and 
eliminated, nay-said that we all will be living..." Thus Dasharatha had gone on appealing in his love for his sons. [1-75-9]

While Dasharatha is speaking in that way that intransigent Bhaargava Rama of Sage Jamadagni uncaring for those merciful 
words of Dasharatha addressed Rama of Dasharatha alone. [1-75-10]

These are the two strong and sturdy unsurpassed longbows, well-designed by gods and well-crafted by Vishvakarma, the Divine 
Architect, and these are very important among all bows and well-worshipped by all worlds... one broken in your, and the 
other in my hand... [1-75-11]

Oh, best one among men, out of the two longbows gods gave one to restive Trymbaka, God Shiva for a combat with demon Tripura, 
and oh, Kakutstha, that bow alone is the annihilator of Tripura, the demon... and you have broken that alone... [1-75-12]

This is the second one and the choicest gods gave this to Vishnu, thereby this is named after Him as 'Vishnu's bow...' 
this is an indestructible and enemy-citadel conquering longbow... and this is identical in its efficacy with Rudra's longbow... 
[1-75-13, 14a]

Once, all the gods were asking the Grandparent, Brahma, as to who is powerful and who is less powerful among the blue-throated 
Shiva and Vishnu... but the Grandparent Brahma on inferring the intent of gods started to create adversity among those two, 
Shiva and Vishnu, for the Grandparent is the best adherer of truthfulness, as truth cannot be demonstrated on hearsay evidence... 
[1-75-14b, 15, 16a]

&nbsp;

<font color="#B3003A">Legend:</font> Brahma thought that it would better to enact a drama to cleanse the one-sided mentalities 
of these lesser gods. So, he started to write the script, and himself becoming the writer-director of that drama. That script 
is hereunder.

&nbsp;

Brahma: Mahadeva, who is the destroyer of Tripura, or say triple-citadels?

Shiva: Why? It is me, of course...

Brahma: Why do you boast that way of yourself? It is the long-arrow of your longbow, isn't it?

Shiva: Yes of course...

Brahma: Then Vishnu was presiding deity of that long-bow... isn't t?

Shiva: Yes, it is he, but I shot it from my bow... basically, is this a confusion, or, are you playing any part of Narada...

Brahma: Not so, the other day Vishnu was telling that he alone did that master task...

Shiva: How can it be! In the triple of doer-deed-instrument, instrument cannot become the doer... has his language gone 
topsy-turvy, noun is becoming verb and verb is lost to adjective and...

Brahma: Ok, Ok... we do not care much for grammar as we care more for communication, grammar is paNini's headache... but 
what he said is that he alone did it... not you...

Shiva: Then why I am called... why that longbow is given to me... you should have got it done by Vishnu... 
why calling me... you have unnecessarily 
spoiled my dance program...

Brahma: Not that... I said what he said... let's not quarrel among ourselves...

Shiva: I not only quarrel but wage war, if it comes to my interests and my devotees' interest... how many times I have not 
done so...

Brahma: That is what Vishnu was telling... every time you give a boon to every demon, and involve yourself in enmeshment, 
and Vishnu has come to come and rescue... have he forgotten the episode of bhasmaasura... thus Vishnu is saying and asking...

Shiva: Now I don't tolerate... I will take him to task...

Exit Shiva - Enter Vishnu. Brahma reverses the above dialogue and says that to Vishnu

Vishnu: No, No, highly objectionable... I will take him to task... I will take him to task...

Exit All. War Started.

Owing to their animosity then occurred a fierce and hair-raising war among Shiva and Vishnu, as each aspired victory for 
himself... [1-75-16b, 17a]

By the 'hum' sound of Vishnu that ruinously overpowering longbow of Shiva is broken, and the triple-eyed God, Mahadeva, 
is frozen... [1-75-17b, 18a]

Then gods along with the assemblages of sages and celestial carana-s have come together and appealed to those two for appeasement 
in the matter of wielding authority, and then those two superior gods, Shiva and Vishnu, went into a state of amity... [1-75-18b, 
19a]

"On seeing the bow of Shiva rendered inert by the mettlesomeness of Vishnu, from then on the gods along with the assemblages 
of sages deemed Vishnu to be the paramount... [1-75-19b, 20a]

That celebrated Rudra on his part with indignation has handed over that longbow, which is already fitted with unloosened 
arrow, to the sagely king among Videha kings, namely Devaraata... [1-75-20b, 21a]

Oh, Rama, this alone is that enemy-citadel conquering longbow of Vishnu, and Vishnu handed over this to Sage Riciika, the 
son of Bhrigu, as a trustworthy trust... [1-75-21b, 22a]

That great-resplendent Sage Riciika on his part has handed over this divine bow to his son with unmatchable deeds of religious 
merit, who is my father Sage Jamadagni... [1-75-22b, 23a]

Adhering to a barbarous mentality Kaartaviirya Arjuna put my father to death, when the ascetically powerful father of 
mine has isolated himself from arsenal... [1-75-23b, 24a]

Oh, Rama, on hearing the unregenerate and highly perfidious murdering of my father, I rancorously extirpated Kshatriya-s 
as and when they are born, that too not for one time, but I did so for thirty-seven times going around the earth... and 
on getting the entire earth under my control I performed Vedic-ritual, and at the end of that Vedic-ritual, I gave all that 
earth to sage Kashyapa, a sage with divine soul and with pious observances, as a ritualistic-generosity... and I am at present 
on Mt. Mahendra practising ascesis and thus conjoined are the powers of ascesis in me... [1-75-24b, c, 25, 26a]

On hearing about the breakage of Shiva's longbow, then I promptly came here. Thereby, oh, Rama, wield this supernatural 
and superlative longbow of Vishnu, which is passed on to me from my forefathers and my father. Keep your fealty to Kshatriya-hood 
in view, and wield this as you have wielded Shiva's longbow... [1-75-26b, 27]

Take an aim with an arrow that conquers enemy's citadels fixing it on this supramundane longbow... and oh, Kakutstha, should 
you be capable of it, thereafter I will give you a duel... [1-75-27]

Then on the next day morning after getting the ritual liturgies performed through sages, he that articulator Janaka articulated 
this to sage Shataananda, the royal priest. [1-70-1]

My younger brother renowned thus as Kushadhvaja, a highly self-righteous one and a highly brilliant one is ruling from 
the auspicious and holy city named Saankaasya, which city is surrounded by River Ikshumati as a natural moat, in which moat 
bastions of tridents are staked all around... and my brother presides over that city as if he is sitting in the Pushpaka 
aircraft of richly-rich god Kubera, and as though supping the sugarcane juice-like waters of River Ikshumati... [1-70-2, 
3]

"And I wish to see him, as he is the nominated benefactor of this Vedic-ritual of mine, and he too shall become a rejoicer 
in partaking the joyousness of this marriage... " So said Janaka to Shataananda. [1-70-4]

That way when Janaka asseverated that enunciation in the presence of Shataananda, Shataananda in turn ordered and summoned 
envoys, and then some alacritous envoys have come, whom Janaka ordered to proceed to his brother. [1-70-5]

By the order of the king those envoys who have speedy horses have travelled on to city Saankaasya speedily, to lead forth 
that tigerly man Kushadhvaja that speedily, which is as good as fetching Vishnu by order of Indra. [1-70-6]

On arriving in city Saankaasya those envoys have seen king Kushadhvaja and on submitting what has happened to the king about 
Rama's breaking of Shiva's bow, and they have also submitted the point of view of Janaka regarding marriages of four daughters. 
[1-70-7]

On hearing that event from the worthy envoys whose speed is praiseworthy, king Kushadhvaja came right away to Mithila by 
the order of king Janaka. [1-70-8]

Kushadhvaja addressed himself to the insightful one and a compassionate person in the duty of an elder brother, namely Janaka, 
and on reverencing sage Shataananda firstly, next he has reverenced his fondly affectionate brother Janaka, and then he 
sat upon a majestic seat, that which is befitting to kings. [1-70-9, 10a]

Both the brothers of unlimited self-refulgence having assumed their high seats, they who are distinguished for their righteous 
acts have started to send Sudaamana, the distinguished minister. [1-70-10b, 11a]

"Oh, minister plenipotentiary, Sudaamana, you please proceed immediately to king Dasharatha, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s with 
illimitable resplendence, and let that invincible king Dasharatha be led hither along with his sons and along with his Vedic-celebrants..." 
Thus Janaka ordered Sudaamana, the minister. [1-70-11b, 12a]

Accordingly Sudaamana has gone to the visitatorial-palace of the promoter of Raghu's heritage, namely Dasharatha, and he 
said this on appearing before that king duly bowing down and hailing the king. [1-70-12b, 13a]

"Oh, valiant king, oh, sovereign of Ayodhya, his highness the sovereign of Mithila from the heritage of Videha kings is 
poised for seeking an audience with your highness, along with your highness' royal-priest Vashishta and other mentors..." 
The minister Sudaamana said so to Dasharatha. [1-70-13b, 14a]

On hearing that best minister's words, then king Dasharatha came to the place where Janaka is available, along with his 
kinsmen and the assemblages of sages. [1-70-14b, 15a]

That sententious king Dasharatha said this to the king from the lineage of Videha kings, Janaka, who is with his mentors, 
kinsfolk, and ministers. [1-70-15b, 16a]

"Oh, exalted king Janaka, you already appreciate that this godly sage Vashishta is godlike to the bloodline of Ikshvaku-s, 
and in all affairs he is our internuncio... [1-70-16b, 17a]

"Should an assent be given by Sage Vishvamitra, along with all the great sages present here, this equanimous Vashishta will 
narrate about my bloodline, lineally..." And, to the nod of Vishvamitra Dasharatha become reticent, and then the godly and 
sententious sage Vashishta who is along with his men of the cloth said these sentences to the king of Videha, namely Janaka. 
[1-70-17b, 18, 19a]

The Unprovable emanated the timeless, changeless and perishless Brahma, and from that Being, namely Brahma, Mariichi is 
begotten, and Kaashyapa is the son of Mariichi, and the Sun is begotten from Kaashyapa, and Manu is said to be the son of 
the Sun... [1-70-19b, 20]

Manu is the earliest Prajaapati and Ikshvaaku is the son of Manu, and that Ikshvaaku is the first king of Ayodhya... know 
thus... [1-70-21]

The son of Ikshvaaku is the legendary Kukshi, thus he is renowned, and the famous Vikukshi is the son of Kukshi... 
[1-70-22]

From that most brilliant and courageous Vikukshi, Baana emerged as son, and the highly refulgent and valinat Anaranya is 
the son of Baana... [1-70-23]

Pruthu is the son of Anaranya, and Trishanku is Pruthu's son, and the highly renowned Dhundumaara happened to be the son 
of Trishanku... [1-70-24]

Dhundumaara begot a highly glorious and a speediest charioteer Yuvanaashva as son, and Mandhaata emerged as the son of 
Yuvanaashva... [1-70-25]


Maandhaata engendered the highly noble Susandhi as son, and even Susandhi engendered two sons, namely Dhruvasandhi and 
Prasenajit... [1-70-26]

From Dhruvasandhi, an illustrious one named as Bharata is begotten, and Bharata begot a highly effulgent son named as Asita... 
[1-70-27]

To which Asita, kings like Haihaya-s, Taalajanghaa-s, and the valiant Shashabindu-s have become adversaries and kings in 
hostility, he had to wage war with them... [1-70-28]

While counterattacking those kings, Asita is dethroned in war and then he reached Himalayas along with his two wives... 
[1-70-29]

Asita was with his meagre forces when he was in Himalayas, and there he drew nigh of his Time. At the time of his demise 
two of his wives were pregnant, and one of two wives gave toxic food to the co-wife for abortion... thus we heard... [1-70-30-31a]

There was a saint named Cyavana, the heir of Sage Bhrigu, who in fascination with best and beautiful mountains then taking 
shelter on Himalayas. [1-70-31b, 32a]

One of the two wives of Asita, the lotus-petal eyed and highly fortunate one queen came there desirous of a best son, and 
reverenced the sage who is godly in his glow... [1-70-32b-33a]

Another queen Kaalindi who administer food poison to her co-wife has also come to the sage, and she too reverenced him. 
That sage spoke to her who received poison from her co-wife regarding the birth of her son. [1-70-34]

'Oh, highly fortunate lady, a very good son and a very mighty son is there in your womb. Soon you will give birth to a 
highly vigorous, highly refulgent son and that illustrious one will take birth with toxicity, but there is no need to worry...' 
So said Sage Cyavana to the queen of Asita who received the poison. [1-70-35]

On reverencing Sage Cyavana that husband devout princess whose husband is no more that lady gave birth to a son... [1-70-36]

"Because he took birth along with the poison administered to his mother by her co-wife, he became Sagara, the emperor..." 
[1-70-37]

From Sagara it is Asamanja and from Asamanja it is Amshuman, and from Amshuman it is Diliipa, and the son of Diliipa is 
Bhageeratha... [1-70-38]

From Bhageeratha it is Kakutstha, from Kakutstha it is Raghu, and Raghu's son is the great resplendent Pravriddha, who 
is reduced to a human flesh eater, and he is also known as Kalmaashapaada... and from him, that Pravriddha, Shankana is born... 
[1-70-39, 40a]

Shankana's son is Sudarshana, and from Sudarshana it is Agnivarsna... And Shiigraga is the son of Agnivarsna, and Shiighraga's 
son is Maru and from Maru it is Prashushruka, and Ambariisha is the son of Prashushruka... [1-70-41]

Ambariisha's son was Nahusha, the emperor and Yayaati is the son of Nahusha, but Naabhaaga is born to Yayaati... [1-70-42]

Aja was Naabhaaga's son and from Aja, this Dasharatha is manifest, and from him, from this Dasharatha, these brothers, 
Rama and Lakshmana are born... [1-70-43]

"Oh, best one among men, Janaka, from the beginning this bloodline of Ikshvaaku-s is spotlessly immaculate, immensely impeccable, 
indomitable, and irreproachable, and in respect of these kings born in this line of blood, oh, king Janaka, I espouse that 
it will be meetly of you to offer your seemly daughters to this seemly pair of Rama and Lakshmana..." So said Vashishta 
to king Janaka. [1-70-44, 45]

On listening the narration of Sage Vishwamitra about Ganga's descent along with 
Lakshmana, Rama went into a great astonishment, and then addressed Vishvamitra. 
[1-45-1]

The blessed legend you have narrated about the digging of an ocean at the behest 
of Sagara, Ganga's alighting, and Bhageeratha filling it with the water of Ganga 
is sacrosanct and even highly amazing. [1-45-2]

Oh, enemy-inflamer, for two of us entire night rolled by as if it is a single moment 
while we were thinking about the episode you have narrated in its entirety. [1-45-3]

While thinking about the auspicious legend of Ganga along with Lakshmana, oh, friend 
of the universe, Vishvamitra, whole night rolled by." Thus Rama is addressing Vishvamitra. 
[1-45-4]

Thereafter on the next fresh dawn the enemy-oppressor Raghava spoke these words 
to sage Vishvamitra, whose affluence is nothing but asceticism, and who by now has 
performed his daily chores of rituals. [1-45-5]

We have listened the praiseworthy legend of River Ganga, and the deific night 
has also passed by while listening such a legend, we may now cross over the very 
same prominent and merited River Ganga, the tri-path-cruiser. [1-45-6]

"This boat which is suitable for the embarkation of the sages whose deeds are pious, 
and which is comfortably blanketed with mats in its deck has come here, and indeed 
on knowing about the visit of your holiness to this place the sages have fetched 
it." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-45-7]

Hearing the words of great-souled Raghava, Vishvamitra of Kusha dynasty, started 
to cross over the River Ganga along with the assemblage of sages, and with both 
the Raghava-s. [1-45-8]

Arriving at the northern bank of River Ganga they have honoured the group of sages 
who ferried them up to here and sent them off. Then sojourning on the riverbank 
of Ganga they have seen the city called Vishaala. [1-45-9]

The great sage Vishvamitra then quickly started along with Rama and Lakshmana to 
the charming and admirable city Vishaala, which in comparison is like heaven. [1-45-10]

Then Rama, whose flair for knowing everything is high, became suppliant duly adjoining 
his palms, and enquired about the prominent city Vishala with the great Sage Vishvamitra. 
[1-45-11]

"Oh, great sage, which dynasty of kings is ruling from this city of Vishaala? Let 
safeness betide you, I am interested to hear of it and indeed I am highly inquisitive 
about it." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1- 45-12]

Hearing that sentence of Rama then the eminent sage Vishvamitra has commenced to 
narrate the legend of ancient Vishaala. [1-45-13]

Oh, Rama, I will tell you about the auspicious legend of Indra as I was told, and 
you listen to it as I tell. Oh, Raghava, indeed you may now listen to the quintessence 
of what has happened in this country. [1-45-14]

Once in Krita era, oh, Rama, the sons of Lady Diti were extremely energetic, whereas 
the sons of her younger sister Lady Aditi were vigorous and highly righteous. [1-45-15]

"Oh, tigerly-man, Rama, then those great-souls speculated as to 'how we can thrive 
without ageing, illness, and likewise without death.' [1-45-16]

A thought occurred to those masterminds who were thinking on that matter clueing 
them up, 'we indeed can get elixir of life by churning the Milky Ocean.' [1-45-17]

Deciding upon to churn the Milky Ocean then made Vasuki, Thousand-headed King of 
Snakes, as the churning rope and Mt. Mandara as stirrer, and those brothers whose 
energy is unlimited have started churning the Milky Ocean thoroughly. [1-45-18]

After a thousand years, the Thousand-headed serpent Vaasuki, which is being 
used as churning rope, is incapacitated to bear the friction of churning and fanged 
the cliffs of Mt. Mandara. Thereby a great lot of venom is disgorged from the heads 
of that serpent Vaasuki, which venom on melting the rocks of Mt. Mandara became 
the holocaustic poison called <em>haalaahala</em>. [1-45-19]

A lethal poison similar to inferno known as <em>haalaahala</em> has started to fulminate 
therefrom, by which whole universe of gods, non-gods and humans is burnt down. [1-45-20]

The gods seeking shelter then approached Rudra, the Cardinal God, Endower of Solace, 
and who husbands all the created animals inclusive of human-animals, namely Shiva, 
and they prayed to him saying 'save, save us.' [1-45-21]

This way while the gods are praying the Lord and God of Gods, namely Shiva, then 
handling his disc and conch-shell Vishnu has also revealed himself at that place. 
[1-45-22]

And Vishnu smilingly spoke to wielder of trident Rudra, 'oh, god the best, whatever 
element that has emerged from the churning of Milk Ocean by gods, that shall belong 
to you, isn't it. By virtue of your position as the foremost god among gods, oh, 
omnicompetent god Shiva, you please accept this poison applying yourself to that 
position of foremost god, and deeming this poison, haalahala, as a foremost oblation 
to your godhood'. [1-45-23, 24]

Saying so Vishnu, the best one among gods, has disappeared then and there only. 
And on observing the scare of gods and also on paying heed to the words of the Wielder 
of Bow called <em>shaar~Nga</em>, namely Vishnu, god Shiva gulped that lethal poison,
<em>haalaahala </em>, as if it is ambrosia. [1-45-25, 26a]

The god of gods Hara then left for his abode Kailash parting with other gods, and 
oh, Rama, the joy of Raghu's dynasty, the gods and non-gods have continued to churn 
the Milky Ocean. [1-45-26b, 27a]

Now the loftiest mountain that is being used as stirrer, namely Mt. Mandara, has 
caved into the netherworld, thereby the gods along with gandharva-s have prayed 
to Madhusuudana, the other name of Vishnu. [1-45-27b, 28a]

 'You alone are the recourse to all beings, especially to the dwellers in heavens, 
oh ambidextrous god Vishnu, you safeguard us, it will be apt of you elevate the 
mountain.' So prayed gods to Vishnu. [1-45-28b, 29a]

Hearing the prayer of gods Vishnu, Hrisheekesha, the controller of senses, adopting 
the form of a tortoise and positioning the stirring Mt. Mandara on that tortoiseshell, 
he lay recumbent at the bottom of Milky Ocean as a base to the stirrer. [1-45-29b, 
30a]

Keshava then reached out his hand and grasped the mountaintop as he is the Cosmic-Soul, 
and thus staying amid gods that Supreme Person Vishnu participated in churning the 
ocean by holding the stirring mountain upright. [1-45-30b, 31a]

After a thousand years of churning, then a male personality, an epitome of Life 
Sciences, namely <strong>aayurveda</strong> , a highly righteous soul, named Dhanvantari, 
has firstly surfaced with his arm-rest-stick and with his handy water-vessel, and 
then the remarkably elegant Apsara-s, angelic damsels, have emerged next to him 
from the Milky Ocean. [1-45-31b, 32]

Choicest females have come out an elixir obtained on absolute churning of the waters 
of Milk Ocean, oh, best one among men, Rama, thereby that genera of females became 
Apsara-s. [1-45-33]

Six hundred millions of such Apsara-s with amazing dazzle have emerged from the 
churning of Milky Ocean, oh, descendent of Kakutstha, and their maidservants who 
emerged along with them are innumerable. [1-45-34]

Anybody either from gods or demons espoused them, and when none espoused them they 
are virtually reckoned as 'general-purpose' Apsara-females. [1-45-35]

Oh, descendent of Raghu, then the heaven-sent damsel Vaaruni came up from Milky 
Ocean searching for her espousal, who is the daughter of Varuna, the Rain-god, and 
who incidentally is the presiding deity of hard liquors and also called as <em>sura</em>. 
[1-45-36]

Oh, Rama, the sons of Diti, namely asuraa-s, have not espoused that daughter of 
Rain-god, but oh, brave Rama, the sons of Aditi on their part, namely sura-s, have 
espoused that impeccable Vaaruni. [1-45-37]

Thereby the sons of Diti are called <em>asuraa</em>-s, and the sons of Aditi are 
called <em>suraa</em>-s, and gods are delighted and rejoiced on espousing Vaaruni. 
[1-45-38]

Then a best horse called Ucchaishravaa has emerged, oh, Rama, the best among men, 
and then a gem of a jewel, called Kaustubha, and like that <em>amrita</em>, the 
Supreme ambrosial elixir of gods, have also emerged. [1-45-39]

Owing to the dispute regarding the possession of that ambrosia, oh, Rama, then 
there chanced a rampant ethnic havoc, and then the sons of Aditi have havocked the 
sons of Diti. [1-45-40]

All the asura-s and demons have come to one side against sura-s, and there occurred 
a very gruesome war which was perplexing to all the triad of universe viz., ethereal, 
real and surreal spheres. [1-45-41]

When everything is wading into annihilation then that omnicompetent Vishnu swiftly 
impounded Amrita, the Divine Elixir, by assuming his illusory power of Mohini. [1-45-42]

Whoever confronted that Eternal and Supreme Person, namely Vishnu, in that war, 
then Vishnu whose blaze is threefold as manifest in the sun, fire and lightning, 
has pulverised him. [1-45-43]

In this horrendous war between the progeny of Diti, namely demons, and the progeny 
of Aditi, namely gods, the sons of Aditi being gods, have altogether massacred the 
demonic sons of Diti. [1-45-44]

"On eliminating the demonic sons of Diti and on acquiring kingdom of heaven, that 
eliminator of enemy cities, namely Indra, happily ruled the worlds that are inclusive 
of sages and caarana-s." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about Vishaala 
city and its emergence. [1-45-45]

We need not wait for any invitation or wedding card or call for this marriage, as all are welcome, equally and individually. 
Let us go there straight, without any introductions and preliminaries.

On which day the king Dasharatha made the impressive cow donations or, initiatory rites, on that day alone the valiant Yudhaajit 
turned up. [1-73-1]

Yudhaajit, the son of Kekaya king and the brother of Kaikeyi, thus the direct maternal uncle of Bharata, having seen and 
asked after the wellbeing of Dasharatha said this to him. [1-73-2]

The ruler and king of Kekaya, viz., my father and your father-in-law, has affectionately asked after the wellbeing of all, 
and in whose wellbeing you are interested at my place, they are all hale and healthy as of now... [1-73-3]

Oh, Raghu's legatee, oh, best king, my father and the king of Kekaya is interested to see my sister Kaikeyi's son, Bharata, 
and for that reason I am sent to Ayodhya... [1-73-4]

"Oh, lord of the land, in Ayodhya I have heard that you went to Mithila along with your sons for their marriages, and wishing 
to see my sister's son Bharata I promptly travelled here..." Thus Yudhaajit told Dasharatha. [1-73-5, 6a]

Then king Dasharatha on seeing the adorable guest who arrived in his presence, and who is a merited one for adoration, Dasharatha 
adored Yudhaajit well, with full observances. [1-73-6b, 7a]

Then on taking rest for that night along with his noble-minded sons, and again on getting up in the next morning, and on 
performing morning-observances as a duty-bound king, Dasharatha arrived at the hall of Vedic-ritual, keeping the sages in 
his forefront. [1-73-7b-8]

Rama arrived at his father together with all of his brothers, keeping sage Vashishta and other eminent-saint ahead of them, 
on an opportune and appropriate hour called 'Victory...' and all the bridegrooms are adorned with all kinds of jewellery 
appropriate for the wedding time, and all have performed the auspicious ceremony for marriage-thread, conducted prior to 
the marriage and, all have thread-bands tied around their wrists, as they all have performed an auspicious ceremony antecedent 
to marriage ceremony. [1-73-9, 10a]

Then that godly sage Vashishta on going from Vedic-ritual hall to marriage hall said this to Janaka, "Oh, best one among 
best people, oh, king Janaka, having performed the auspicious marriage-thread ceremony, Dasharatha along with his sons is 
looking forward for the donor... [1-73-10b, 11]

"In marriages all the <font color="#B3003A">puruSaartha-s</font> , the component values of life, namely rightness, riches, 
revelries, and results of final release will be occurring only if the benefactor and beneficiary meet, isn't it. Hence let 
king Dasharatha come, and then on actualising this best marriage you too will be doing your best devoir as royal priest... 
[1-73-12]

Janaka is not just a decidedly valiant king but he is the profound knower of probity also, besides being an unreservedly 
generous king, hence he has already made all arrangements, and when he is spoken in this way by Vashishta that king replied 
this sentence to that right honourable Vashishta. [1-73-13]

Who is that doorman that prevents your entry? Or, for whose orders you all await with a bated breath? Do you hesitate in 
your own house, or what? This kingdom is as good as yours... isn't so... [1-73-14]

Oh, eminent-saint Vashishta, on absolutely performing the auspicious ceremony for the marriage-thread, and thereby tying 
thread-band at wrists my daughters have already arrived, and they are at the base of the Altar of Fire, like the irradiant 
jets of flames of radiant fire... [1-73-15]

"I am already ready and awaiting for you remaining at this Altar of Fire. Let everything be done indeed without any deterrents. 
What for the king Dasharatha is dawdling..." So said Janaka to Vashishta. [1-73-16]

On hearing that sentence of Janaka, then Dasharatha started towards marriage hall, and then he started to enter his sons 
one by one, four in all, into marriage hall along with all of the assemblages of sages. [1-73-17]

Then that king from Videha bloodline, Janaka, said in this way to Vashishta, "Oh, the knower of punctilios, oh, Brahma-sage, 
oh, masterly sage, along with other sages you make happen all of the marriage ceremonies of Rama, the rejoicer of the world..." 
Thus Janaka spoke to Vashishta. [1-73-18, 19a]

Thus said, that godly sage Vashishta on saying, "so be it," to Janaka, embarked on arranging Altar of Fire keeping sage 
Vishvamitra and the virtuous sage Shataananda afore of him, and that sage with great ascesis, Vashishta, has arranged an 
Altar of Fire in the midpoint of the cool-thatched manorial-marriage-shed, decorating it with sandal paste and flowers. 
Then he promptly sanctified variously coloured handy vessels, and lid-like concave earthen vessels, which are full with 
just sprouted sprigs, and he sanctified even other golden vessels, censers with fumes of incenses, conch-shell like vessels, 
and short handled wooden scoops for scooping oblatory items from vessels for putting it in long-handled scoops, and long-handled 
wooden scoops to drop those oblatory items into Ritual-fire, and vessels filled with oblatory items like ghee, water, milk 
etc., and vessels filled with toasted rice-flakes and vessels filled with holy yellow-rice duly treated with turmeric, and 
he sanctified all articles of wedding ceremony by sprinkling holy-yellow-rice, as a kind of dry-ablution. [1-73-19b, 20, 
21, 22, 23a]

Then that great resplendent and eminent-saint Vashishta neatly overlaid even-sized sacred grass on that Altar of Fire synchronising 
with Vedic-chants, and on preparing Ritual-fire by rubbing two wooden sticks, called <font color="#B3003A">araNi</font> 
, he placed that fire in the pit of Altar, which is aflame now, and then reverently and in tune with the Vedic-hymns he 
effused oblational liquids into that Altar of Fire, with short-handled and long-handled wooden scoops. [1-73-23b, 24]

Then that king Janaka led forth Seetha, who by now is decorated with every variety of bridal jewellery, and on positioning 
her en face Raghava in the presence of Altar of Fire, then Janaka addressed Rama who is the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's 
rejoice. [1-73-25, 26a]

"This is Seetha, my daughter, she acquits herself in whatever duty you undertake. Take her wishfully, let safeness betide 
you, take her palm into your palm..." [1-73-26b, 27a]

Here Sita stands, my daughter fair, / The duties of thy life to share. / Take from her father, take thy bride, / Join hand 
to hand, and bliss betide! / - Ralph T. H. Griffith

The above is very a convenient and readymade gist of that verse. But the three pronouns in the first stanza <em>iyam, mama, 
tava</em> 'this, mine, yours' are supposed to play havoc in deciphering the latent meaning of this verse. Let us look at 
some of them.

Seetha is very much there in the front of Rama, and Janaka might have shown her and told "take her...' Why this <em>iyam</em> 
i.e., "this" It is explained as below:

Janaka: This and this alone is Seetha, the unique, exceptional and earmarked one for you... do not confuse yourself by looking 
at Urmila, Maandavi and Shrutakiirti they are for your brothers

Rama: Why she alone is earmarked for me?

Janaka: Because she is 'Seetha '

Rama: What, you mean a furrow, or a sillion...

[Sillion is an old word for furrow, not found in dictionaries, but used by poet Hopkins in his 'The Windhover' sheer plod 
makes plough down sillion /]

Janaka: Yes, everything comes out of earth... from coal to gold, flora to fauna, rivers to ridges everything.... a morsel 
of food comes from a handful of mud in this mortal world.... your being, becoming and belonging in, are manifest only because 
of that earth and earth enables you to live on her without seeking any requital or reciprocation and earth is the symbol 
of enduing toleration, though you dig, dung or dredge it.... hence, Seetha is the symbol for mortal truth, and mortally 
tolerant womanhood and you people want to know the Unknown in the skies, but do not wish to know what that is right under 
your feet... <em>vedaaham etam puruSham mahaantam aadityavarNam tamasaH parastaat |</em> if the Supreme Person beyond 
darkness is knowable, and sages like Vishvamitra know you and tell that you are some Super Soul <em>aham vedmi mahaatmaanam 
raamam satyaparaakramam - bala 19-14</em> likewise you shall know <em>iyam siitaa,</em> for she is somebody to match you... 
have you not mugged up Veda-s, Upanishad-s

Rama: Why not every bit of it...&nbsp; you name, it I tell it

Janaka: How does the fifth mantra of eighth topic in Chaandogya Upanishad reads?

<u>Adi Shankara's commentary</u>: There are three letters that denote the Absolute <em>sa, ta, yam</em>; and the syllable
<em>ii</em> on <em>sat</em> is for easy pronunciation. The letter <em>sa</em> indicates immortality and the word <em>ta</em> 
mortality, and the syllable <em>yam</em> conditions and bridges both the above ' <u>Ramanuja comment:</u> The letter <em>
sat</em> is immortality and the letter <em>ti</em> is mortality and <em>yam</em> conditions both, hence <em>sattiyam</em> 
is indicative of Spiritedness and non-spiritedness ' <u>Madhvaacaarya</u> says: <em>sat</em>, delivered immortal souls;
<em>ti</em> yet to be delivered bounded souls; <em>yam</em> both the delivered and bounded souls.

Janaka: Seetha is that <em>yam</em> the conjunctive, conditioner, bridge between the mortal and immortal, <em>setu - eSa 
setu iti vidhaaraNaa</em> the presiding deity of <em>cetana-acetana</em> dynamic, static beings. oh, Rama, it is said in Vishnu 
Puraana that Seetha is your lookalike, minus your sky-blue complexion, <em>raaghavatve bhavet siitaa...</em> It is said 
in yet another scripture, <em>yathaa mayaa jagat vyaaptam - svaruupeNa svabhaavataH | tayaa vyaaptam idam vishvam niyantrii 
ca tathaa iishvarii ||</em> 'as to how I am all pervading, likewise She, Goddess Lakshmi, is all pervading and the controller 
of the universe ' and if you want to establish yourself as the protector of this world, you have to take this and this Seetha 
alone, as she is the cause for the desired effect of yours and, she is from Mother Earth <em>ratna-garbhaa</em> and you are 
a sapphirine boy from a mother, and a sapphire shines only if it is studded in earth-given gold <em>anargham api maaNikyam 
hemaashrayam apekShate</em> otherwise you, your incarnation, your epic, your mission, why one or two, everything concerning 
you will be futile, and you have to return to your milky abode empty handed, and here on earth, every house breeds one or 
more Ravana-s

Rama: How am I to conclude 'this' as 'that...' I mean Goddess Lakshmi

Janaka: Certain aspects are to be inferred because they are unmanifest. Fire on the mountain is unmanifest but smoke is 
manifest, hence fire is inferred. So also, <em>ayam iishvarii</em> is manifest as <em>iyam</em> this girl... from <em>siitaa</em> 
furrow, sillion, a narrow trench in ground made by ploughshare... as a small seed manifests into a gigantic banyan tree, 
and from this the nature of her non-foetal birth, it is to be inferred likewise, and only because of it she is someone above 
mortals. Because you have come as a mortal she has to take birth as a mortal, as an inseparable entity of yours

Rama: Then why can't she fall from sky or from other planet?

Janaka: She cannot. Your connection with this earth is age-old and you love it. Because you love earth, she has to emerge 
from earth, a lovely act for you.

Rama: Then why <em>mama sutaa...</em> she can be fostered in any orphanage

Janaka: Not so. An auspicious thing or being requires a sanctum sanctorum... Mithila is one such... and Videha-s are not 
just kings of this part of land, but they are priests of pious or holy things like the bow of Shiva. You know the naming 
of <em>vi-deha...</em> it is not 'without bodies...' but transcending bodily affairs Thus she chose this as her background 
and as she presented herself to me as baby girl, I have look upon her as <em>mama sutaa</em> 'my daughter ' And many, many 
kings sought her hand in marriage, but I refused and they warred with me, whereby I had to call for the forces of gods to 
counterattack the enemy forces; perhaps, you might not have heard that humans can summon gods; thus gods are at my disposal; 
a prayer of mine brings them here, either for a war or for a ritual So, do not take me or my daughter Seetha, <em>iyam siitaa 
mama sutaa</em> as some ignoramus and insignificant dullards

Rama: Then why you want me to take back, as though she belonged to me for eons, but lost in a journey

Janaka: Yes, she is yours from ages unknown; I cannot donate her in <em>kanyaa-daana</em> 'bestowal of bride ' because your 
marriage is eternal. But you two have arrived here in human forms, so conduct yourselves in conformity with human customs.... 
that is why I tell <em>pratiicCha enaaam</em> ' take her back, wishfully ' for that saying of mine get no anger on me;
<em>bhadram te</em> 'let safeness betide' you; by this act of yours <em>paaNim gR^ihNiSva paaNinaa</em> ' you take her palm 
into your palm ' that which is customary in human <em>paaNigrahaNa-mahotsava</em> 'wedding ceremony '; by the way, you 
always keep your consort in your heart <em>hR^idaya kamala</em> do not do such things as long as you are on earth for your 
incarnation will be disclosed.... just take her hand and let not this heavenly discourse be leaked out... lest Ravana may 
come to know that you are not human and it will be impossible for you to eliminate that evil, thereby

And we now proceed to the human level import of this verse.

Janaka: '<em>iyam</em> "this girl" who has --- <em>mugdhamanoharamanoj~namohanaatmakasukumaarasoundaryalaavaNyaadau</em>--- 
a beauty par excellence [and par problmatique beauty as well, for Ravana alone has got more words to extol her beauty, as 
in Ch. 46 Aranya ];

so, <em>iyam</em> "this one" is about whom you have heard from day one in the hermitage of Siddha, i.e., when you started 
towards Mithila;

hence, <em>iyam</em> "this one alone" is that girl who is on your psyche from the minute you broke that Shiva's bow, and 
whom you are envisioning <em>praasaade praade ca pathi pathi ca saa pR^iShTataH saa purataH</em> 'on verandas of multistoried 
buildings and in window ledges, on this street and that street, before you, behind you ' during these days of your stay 
in Mithila....

Rama: No, No, No, you are wrong... I did not aim at any girl when aiming to lift that old bow... sorry for your unilateral 
conclusion...

Janaka: No, my dear boy, the condition I stipulated before your touching that bow is bilateral... I clearly said that my 
daughter belongs to one who can lift that bow... you were quick enough to grab the girl, rather than the bow... and in that 
hastiness you even broke that bow... had you declined the girl, you should have declined to lift the bow, also... so,
<em>iyam siita</em> was the only intention of yours when lifting that bow...

Rama; Maybe.. but we want high-born, high-bred girls --- not fatherless, motherless, birth-less orphans

Janaka: You seem to be a doubting Thomas... that's why I said <em>mama sutaa</em> 'my daughter ' when it is said <em>mahataa 
tapasaa raama...</em> ' by high degree ascesis Dasharatha obtained Rama.. what does it mean? So also, I too obtained and 
fostered this girl with much better ascesis [than your father], and even protected her from warring factions [only to give 
back to you ]; bythe way, the environ of Mithila itself is of utmost sanctity and piety... if we are to be lowly subjects, 
why your guru Vishvamitra brought you here, that too by foot don't think that you are taking this girl for your personal 
enjoyment, but it is for a caculated purpose... this girl meets that purpose and her wifehood, as well.... hence I said
<em>sahadharmacarii tava</em> ' she will be in toe with your duties'

<em>tava dharmasahacarii</em> ' whatever is your duty that duty become hers too '..

Rama: Somehow there appears some cacoethes confusion from you, from all the sages, from my father and mothers, even

Janaka: Nothing of that sort is there... if you wish heartily then only you take her... I have not said <em>siitaam dadaami</em> 
'I am donating Seetha ' but I said <em>pratiicCha enaam</em> 'take her, take her back ' or else, she will exit as she came 
and unfulfilled will be your mission... it is up to you to decide.... no compulsion whatsoever...

Rama: Then, let her take hold of my arrow and walk with me round the Altar of Fire, because, for Kshatriya-s that is the 
custom...

Janaka: I know, I know, but this marriage does not fit into any of the eight kinds of marriage prescribed for humans... 
hence I carefully said <em>paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa</em>' take her palm into your palm '

<em>eteShu aShTasu vivaaheShu ayam vivaaho na kopi bhavitum arhati - tat uktalakShaNaabhaavaat | tathaa hi - na taavat 
braahmyaH iti - aahuuya daanaabhaavaat | na api daivaH - kShatriyasya aartivijyaasambhavat | na aarSha - kanyaapitroH

vivaaha iti cet - sahadharmacarii tava - iti uktyaa praajaapatya eva vivaahaH - dk</em>

Rama: This marriage does not fit into any category! Then why this marriage at all!

Janaka: To be in tune with this world's tradition... however, this marriage technically comes under the category of <em>
praajaapatya</em>

Rama: So, you adjusted the rule books... then why me, let her take my hand...

Janaka: The enjoyer has to grab the object of enjoyment, not vice versa... take her now and <em>bhadram te</em> and 'be 
blest '

Janaka: <em>iyam</em> - 'this' girl is a simple match to you who broke the bow of Shiva;

<em>siitaa</em>' born in furrow' a motherless girl, hence, kindly be merciful towards her;

<em>mama sutaa</em> ' my daughter ' rather, a poor fellow's daughter; where I have always been engaged in rituals and ceremonies, 
thereby I may not have brought her up properly, and thereby if she does talk rashly or behave oddly, like an ill-bred girl, 
kindly tolerate and correct her;

<em>sahadhrmacarii iva</em> where <em>iva</em> is ' like ' just take her like your 'custom-bound consort ' and let her 
be useful in ceremonies and rituals, though not for pleasure trips and excursions ';

<em>pratiicCha enaam</em> 'take her ' where the bridegrooms usually woo, court and date girls, send many messages to her 
parents asking for that girl in marriage; but, this girl being an uncommon one, I am begging you to take her;

<em>paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa</em> you take her hand as she is hesitating to take your hand, for your hand is strong enough 
to break an unbreakable bow, she is fearing to take your hand, lest her arm too will be broken;

<em>bhadram te</em> 'be blest ' when you honour our appeal

And there are many, many more shades of meanings derived from this verse, but all culminate to say - 'you two are made for 
each other '

"She who is prosperous and husband-devout, will always be abiding you like your own shadow..." So saying that king Janaka 
then poured forth water into the palms of Rama, which is sanctified with hymns. [1-73-27b, 28a]

Then there occurred great flower-showers from firmament, while sages and gods staying in firmament have exclaimed, "nice... 
fine..." to the drumbeats of heavenly drums. [1-3-28b, 29a]

On handing over his daughter Seetha who is duly sanctified with sanctified waters, King Janaka is completely overwhelmed 
with exhilaration for the successful performance of his bit as a father and he said this. [1-73-29b, 30a]

Come on, Lakshmana, safe betides you... say yes to Urmila, the one who is decided by me to be given to you... take her 
palm into yours... lapse not the time... [1-73-30b, 31a]

Janaka having said to Lakshmana that way, he also addressed Bharata, "Oh, Bharata, the delight of Raghu-s, take Maandavi's 
palm into your palm... [1-73-31b-32a]

That honourable king of Mithila even said to Shatrughna, "oh, dextrous Shatrughna, take the palm of Shrutakiirti into yours... 
[1-73-32b, 33a]

"Oh, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna ... you all are tender-hearted, well-behaved and well-intentioned brothers from 
Kakutstha lineage... without lapse of time take up other ceremonies..." So said Janaka to bridegrooms. [1-73-33b, 34a]

All the four bridegrooms are palminpalmed with all the four brides, paying heed to Janaka's words, and abiding in Vashishta's 
orchestration of Vedic hymns and procedures. [1-73-34b, 35a]

On performing circumambulations along with their wives around the Ritual-fire, and around the Altar of Fire, and that way, 
around king Janaka, the awarder of wives, and around sages as well for they conducted the marriages well, those great-souled 
bridegrooms that have emerged from Raghu's dynasty on performing further deeds of ritual consistent with custom as directed 
by Vashishta, they are all wed. [1-73-35b, 36]

There occurred rich and highly dazzling flower showers from firmament, and that ambience is filled with the drumbeats of 
divine drums and with vocal and instrumental music, and promenades of apsara-s danced, and even the gandharva-s sang tunefully, 
and because it is the marriage of celebrated bridegrooms from Raghu's dynasty, such a charming spectacle is envisioned.. 
[1-73-37, 38]

In this kind of ongoingness of harmonious music of vocal, instrumental and that of dancers, those great resplendent brothers 
married their wives on circumabulating the Ritual-fire fire thrice. [1-73-39]

Then those legatees of Raghu went to their visitatorial-palace with their wives, followed by king Dasharatha along with 
the assemblages of sages, kinfolks, queens and wives included, and Dasharatha feasted his eyes on sons and daughter-in-laws. 
[1-73-40]

Divine sage Narada arrives at the hermitage of Sage Valmiki in order to enlighten him and keep him informed 
of his duty to author the epic poem Ramayana. In the dialogue between these two sages, Valmiki elicits 
from Narada about most virtuous person on earth, namely Rama. In this opening chapter, while eulogizing 
Rama Narada gives an outline of Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes in 
this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality, chastity and the like.

Valmiki Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of Gayatri 
Hymn, and a thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of each letter. Though that 
classification, or dividing verses into thousand chapters is unavailable now, the twenty-four verses 
identified with the 24 letters of Gayatri hymn, called as Gayatri Ramayana, is available and it is given 
in the endnote of this page. In tune with the scheme of Gayatri, Ramayana starts the first verse with 
letter <em>ta</em> an auspicious letter.

		The ascetic Valmiki inquired Naarada - 'who engaged deeply in austerity and study of Vedas, best among the eloquent and eminent among sages' (as follows:). [1-1-1]

	"Who really is that person in this present world, who is virtuous and vigorous, a conscientious 
	one, one who is mindful of good deeds done to him, and also a speaker of truth and who is determined in his deed... [1-1-2]

	"Who is appropriate in disposition... who is interested in welfare of all beings... who is 
	adept and also an able one... also uniquely pleasant to look at... [1-1-3]

	"Who is that self-composed one, who controlled his ire, who is brilliant, non-jealous and whom do even
	the gods fear, when provoked to war... [1-1-4]

"All this I wish to listen from you, oh! Great Sage, you are competent to know this kind of man, 
and indeed my inquisitiveness is immense..." Thus Valmiki enquired with Narada. [1-1-5]

On listening all those words of Valmiki, Narada, the knower of all the three worlds, said "let 
it be heard..." and beckoning at Sage Valmiki to listen attentively, he spoke these words very gladly. 
[1-1-6]

	"Oh! Sage Valmiki, the merits which you have extolled are many, and unattainable. I, after having known from Brahma of such a man with all these merits, will speak on...Let it be heard." Thus Narada started to say. [1-1-7]

"One emerged from Ikshvaku dynasty, known to people as Rama by name. He is with a controlled self, 
highly valorous, resplendent, steadfast and a controller of (vice and vile... or) his own senses. [1-1-8]

"He is a wise one, moralist, eloquent, glorious, and a destroyer of enemies. His arms are lengthy, 
with three lines in the neck [indicative of good fortune], and cheekbones high... [1-1-9]

"He is lion-chested, with concealed collarbones, knee-length are his arms, and his is a long bow, an enemy-subjugator, 
and his emperor's countenance is with a crowning-head and an ample forehead, and his gait is majestic like that of a lion... 
[1-1-10]

"He is built proportionately physically, with limbs poised symmetrically, sinew-chested, wide-eyed, complexioned 
charmingly... he is a prosperous one with all the auspicious features ... 
[1-1-11]

"He is the knower of rectitude, bidden by the truth, also his concern is in the welfare of subjects, 
proficient in prudence, clean in his conduct, self-controlled and an attentive one... 
[1-1-12]

"He equals Lord Vishnu, the Lord of all creatures, Sustainer of the Universe, together with Sri Lakshmi (shriimaan = lakShmiivaan), Eliminator of enemies,
 Protector of the world of living creatures and complete Guardian of probity... 
[1-1-13]

"He is the preserver of his own righteousness and also a champion for adherent's welfare in the same 
righteousness, and he is a scholar in the essence of Veda-s and their ancillaries, too. He is an expert 
in <font color="#B3003A">dhanurVeda</font>, the Art of Archery... [1-1-14]

"He is the knower of the meaning and essence of all the scriptures, excellent at memory, a brilliant one, 
and dear to all the worlds, gentle, level-headed and clear-headed in discriminating and distinguishing... 
[1-1-15]

"Like an ocean that is reached by rivers, that reverential one too is always accessible 
and reachable by clean-minded ones, and he treats all equally, and ever a feast to eye... [1-1-16]

"He who betters the happiness of his mother Kausalya is an embodiment of all noble merits, and in profundity 
he is like an unfathomable ocean, and by fortitude he is unalterable like the kingly Himalayan mountain... 
[1-1-17]

"In valour Rama is comparable to Vishnu, and in his looks he is attractive like the moon, he equals 
the earth in his forgiveness, but he is matchable to world ending fire in his wrath... and in benevolence 
he is identical to Kubera, God of Wealth, and in his candour he is like Dharma itself, the 
Truth personified, with none to rival him... [1-1-18, 19a]

"Lord of the land King Dasaratha with an intent for doing good to the people, affectionately desired to endow with regent-hood to that Rama, 
the eldest and a dear son to Dasaratha and who possessed such merits with true valour, together with best of qualities, 
and concerned for welfare of the people....[1-1-29b, 20, 21a]

"Then seeing the arrangements for the anointment of Rama as crown-prince, Kaikeyi, the dear wife 
and a queen of Dasaratha, solicited boons that were once accorded to her by Dasharatha, for the 
banishment of Rama and anointment of Bharata as boons. [1-1-21b, 22]

		"Bound by his true plighted word and by the noose of righteousness that king Dasharatha 
		exiled his dear son Rama to forests. [1-1-23]

"That warrior Rama went to forest for pleasing Kaikeyi, and as 
directed by his father, and to follow his father's word of honour. [1-1-24]

"While that Rama was going on exile, Lakshmana, endowed with humbleness, and augmentor of his mother Sumitra's joy, and a loving and a 
dear brother to Rama, followed him out of affection, showing brotherly fraternity.[1-1-25, 26a]

	"Even Seetha, daughter-in-law of Dasaratha, and Rama's beloved wife equalling to Rama's life, ever well disposed, born in the family of Janaka and one as though 
	fashioned by a Divine marvel, endowed with all good characteristics and the best among women, followed Rama to forest, like Rohini following the Moon... [1-1-26b, 
	27, 28a]

"The citizens of Ayodhya and his father Dasaratha followed virtuous Rama for a 
distance when he started on his exile. Later Rama reached the tribal chief named Guha, who liked 
Rama, on the bank of River Ganga in a town called Sringaberapura. Together with Guha, 
Lakshmana and Seetha, he left off the charioteer. [1-1-28b, 29, 30a]

"That trio of Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana after going from forest to forest and crossing many a river with much waters, 
by the ordainment of Bharadwaja, arrived at Chitrakuta, and building a handsome cottage there, they lived happily and delightfully 
in the woods there, like gods and gandharvas... [1-1-30b, 31, 32a]

"On Rama going to Chitrakuta thus, King Dasharatha tormented by the grief for son, went to heavens 
weeping for son... [1-1-32b, 33a]

	"On Dasharatha's dying, though Bharata had been appointed for kingship by Sage Vashishta and other Brahmanas, that highly mighty one did not desire kingdom.
	That warrior Bharata went to forest to propitiate the venerable Rama... [1-1-33b. 34]

	"That Bharata, possessed of a worthy way of thinking [to get Rama installed as king], on going to Rama, begged his brother Rama, a great souled one and a 
	truly courageous one. Bharata spoke words in this manner to Rama - "You alone, the knower of probity, be the king." ... ' [1-1-35, 36a]

"Even though Rama was very benevolent, gracious also, highly famed and with great prowess, Rama did not desire kingdom due to father's injunction... [1-1-36b, 37a]

"Thereafter, repeatedly turning Bharata back, the elder brother, Rama, gave his wooden shoes to Bharata and entrusting them to represent him 
for the sake of kingdom. [1-1-37b, 38a]

"That Bharata, thus with a desire unfulfilled, ruled the kingdom from Nandigrama, touching Rama's sandals representing feet of Rama, with an
expectation of Rama's arrival... [1-1-38b, 39a]

"On the departure of Bharata, that splendid Rama, truth-bound, and self-controlled, anticipated the repeated 
visits of citizens and other people. To be undisturbed, Rama then entered Dandaka forests... [1-1-39b, 40]

"That lotus-eyed Rama, on his entering the vast Dandaka forest, killed the demon Viraadha, and 
indeed beheld Sage Sharabhanga and also Sage Suteekhsna, Sage Agastya and likewise Sage Agastya's 
brother... [1-1-41, 42a]

"On Sage Agastya's word, Rama, with great delight, received from Agastya, Indra's bow along with the sword and two quivers with ever replenishing
 arrows... [1-1-42b, 43a]

"During Rama's stay in the forest, all the sages together with other forest dwellers,
approached him for the elimination of ogres and demons... [1-1-43b, 44a]

"He [Rama] agreed to that supplication of those sages dwelling in the forest of demons. A promise was also made by Rama to the sages who equalled 
the fire and who were living in that Dandaka forest about killing of the demons in combat... [1-1-44b, 45]

"While Rama was living there in the Dandaka forest, a guise-changing demoness named Shuurpa-nakha, who was 
a resident of Janasthana, a portion of Dandaka forest, was disfigured by him... [1-1-46]

"Then in a battle, Rama killed all demons who became zealously active incited by Suurphanakha's words, 
including the demons Khara, Trishira, Duushana together with all of their foot-followers... [1-1-47, 48a]

"During Rama's stay in that forest, fourteen thousand demon inhabitants of Janasthana became slain... [1-1-48b, 49a]

		"Then, on hearing the slaughter of his kinsmen, Ravana convulsed in anger and sought to get the help of a 
		demon named Maareecha... [1-1-49b, 50a]

"But Maareecha restrained Ravana telling him many times, 'Oh, Ravana! Rivarly with that formidable 
Rama is not appropriate of you...' [1-1-50b, 51a]

"Then disregarding Maareecha's words and impelled by his own fate, Ravana advanced to the 
place of Rama's hermitage along with Maareecha... [1-1-51b, 52a]

"After taking away of Rama and Lakshmana to a distance by the trickster Maareecha, Ravana stole Rama's wife after killing Jatayu... [1-1-52b, 53a]

"Raghava on seeing the smitten Jatayu and also on hearing about Seetha's abduction, wailed with disturbed senses, 
seething with anguish  ... [1-1-53b, 54a]

"Rama then cremated that vulture Jataayu with that state of anguish, and while searching for Seetha in forest, he 
indeed saw a demon named Kabandha, deformed in his looks and with a terrible appearance... [1-1-54b, 
55]

"That Rama with great arms after slaying Kabandha, cremated him and Kabandha obtanined heaven. Before going to heaven, he spoke thus to Rama:
'Oh Raghava! You proceed to Sabari, a lady with righteous conduct, an expert in probity and a devotee.'... [1-1-56, 57a]

"That great resplendent Rama, the son of Dasaratha, an anhillator of enemies, approached Sabari and was thoroughly honoured by her... [1-1-57b, 58a]

	"Rama was united indeed with the Vanara Hanuma on the banks of Lake Pampa, and upon the word of Hanuma, Rama met with 
	Sugreeva... [1-1-58b, 59b]

"The highly powerful Rama detailed from the beginning all that happened, and in particular the abduction of Seetha, to Sugriva 
and to Hanuma also... [1-1-59b, 60a]

"The Vanara Sugreeva after listening to all that talk of Rama made friendship with Rama delightedly with sacred fire as witness... [1-1-60b, 61a]

"Then out of affection, the incident was related with regard to Sugreeva's enemity with Vali  
in its entirety by the Vanara King with grief to Rama ... [1-1-61b, 62a]

"Then a solemn promise was made by Rama with regards to killing of Vali. In that regard Vanara Sugreeva also described Vali's strength... [1-1-62b, 63a]

"But Sugreeva remained ever doubtful with respect to Raghava, about Raghava's prowess. Sugreeva showed Dundubhi's big and great mountain-like
dead body to gain confidence in Raghava... [1-1-63b, 64]

Great armed and very powerful Rama after seeing the bones of Dundubhi smiled and by the big toe of his foot threw it wholly for ten 
yojana-s length. [1-1-65]

"Then again Rama ripped through seven massive Sala trees with only one great arrow, which not only went through 
the trees but also rent through a mountain, and to the nethermost subterranean of earth, in order to 
create faith in the mind of Sugreeva... [1-1-66]

"Thereafter great monkey Sugreeva with a gladdened heart by that act of Rama, proceeded to cave-like Kishkindha then along with Rama 
and with confidence in Rama's strength... 
[1-1-67]

"Then that best monkey Sugreeva, with a golden hue, made a roaring sound. By that loud sound, the king of monkeys, Vali, emerged out... 
[1-1-68]

"Then after Tara [wife of Vali] permitting, Vali met with Sugreeva in a combat. And Rama killed this Vali with a single arrow there... [1-1-69]

"Then Raghava after killing Vali in a combat as per Sugreeva's plea, installed Sugreeva alone as the king of Vanaras.. [1-1-70]

"That best among monkeys, Sugreeva, after summoning all Vanaras, dispatched them in different directions to behold the daughter of Janaka... [1-1-71]

"After that, the strong Hanuma, upon the word of the vulture Sampati who was elder brother of Jatayu, flew across the salty ocean
 one hundred yojanas in breadth... [1-1-72]

"On reaching the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, Hanuma saw Seetha situated in Ashoka gardens there and meditating on Rama alone... [1-1-73]

"After delivering to Seetha the mark of identification in the form of a ring from Rama and also communicating
 Rama's disposition and consoling Vaidehi, Hanuma destroyed the welcome-arch of Ashoka gardens... [1-1-74]

"After killing five army chiefs and seven minister's sons and crushing the valiant Aksha, Hanuma got into state of captivity... [1-1-75]

"Knowing himself to be free from the captivity of the weapon according to Brahma's boon, the valiant great monkey Hanuma
enduring those demons with self-will who tied his tail with ropes with the intention of burning it, there after burning the city of Lanka while 
 leaving from fire the Seetha of Mithila, got back again to convey the pleasant news to Rama ... [1-1-76, 77]

"Approaching the great Rama and peforming circumambulation around Rama, Hanuma having an inestimable intelligence,
submitted in essence thus: 'Seen Seetha...' [1-1-78]

"There-after, Rama along with Sugreeva and other monkeys went to the shore of Great Ocean, and put the Ocean-god to turmoil with his arrows 
comparable to the Sun... [1-1-79]

"The Ocean-god revealed himself and upon his word, Nala built the bridge across the ocean... [1-1-80]

"Rama, having gone to the city of Lanka by that bridge, killing Ravana in a battle, experienced great shame on getting Seetha back... [1-1-81]

"There-after, Rama spoke harshly to Seetha in the assembly of the people. Being devoted to her husband, that Seetha, intolerant of the
 harsh words of Rama, entered into burning fire... [1-1-82]

"Then, upon the word of Fire-god, having known Seetha to be sinless, Rama became extremely glad.
Worshipped by all gods he became resplendent. By that accomplishment of the great Raghava the three worlds together with mobile and immobile
beings, and with groups of gods and sages became exultant... [1-1-83, 84]

"Enthroning Vibheeshana as the chieftain of demons in Lanka, and with a done deed, 
Rama then rejoiced highly indeed free from distress... [1-1-85]

"After obtaining a boon from the gods, Rama  raised up monkeys from death. He then travelled to Ayodhya by Pushpaka aircraft
surrounded by good hearted ones... 
[1-1-86]

"Rama, with true valour, on going to sage Bharadwaja's hermitage, sent Hanuma to the presence of Bharata... [1-1-87]

"Then, having boarded Pushpaka aircraft again after leaving the hermitage of Bharadwaja, and narrating past history
 to Sugreeva and others about the events in the days of his exile in forests, while flying overhead 
of the very same places, Rama went to Nandigrama... [1-1-88]

"That sinless Rama rejoining with all of his brothers in the village Nandigrama removed his matted hair. 
Thus he, on regaining Seetha and on discarding hermit's role again became 
a householder, and he regained his kingdom also... [1-1-89]

"When Rama is ruling the world will be highly rejoiced and happy, satisfied and abundant, 
also very righteous, wholesome, disease-free, and free from fear of famine..." Thus Narada is 
foreseeing the future and telling Valmiki. [1-1-90]

"While Rama is on the throne men will not see the deaths of their children anywhere in their lifetime, 
and the ladies will remain husband-devouted and unwidowed during their lifetime... [1-1-91]

"In the kingdom of Rama, there will be no fear for his subjects from wildfires, gale-storms or from diseases, 
and there will be no fear from hunger or thieves, nor the cattle will be drowned in floodwaters as well... [1-1-92, 
93a]

"Cities and states as well will be replete with wealth and grains likewise. All his subjects will be highly glad always,
like in Krita yuga... [1-1-93b, 94a]

"Like-wise the highly illustrious Rama having performed hundreds of horse rituals and having donated plentiful gold and crores
of cows and wealth that cannot be counted to Brahmanas and to scholars according to custom... [1-1-94b, 95a]

"In this world Raghava will establish kingly dynasties in hundredfold and he will be maintaining the 
four-caste system positing each in his own duty, may it be caste-bound or provincial-kingdom-bound 
duty, in order to achieve a perfect social harmony... [1-1-96]

"Having served the kingdom for ten thousand years and another one thousand years, i.e. for a total 
of eleven thousand years, Rama will go to the abode of Brahma... [1-1-97]

"This Ramayana is holy, sin-eradicating, merit-endowing, and conformable with the teachings of Vedas.
Whoever reads this Legend of Rama, will be verily liberated of all sins... [1-1-98]

"This Ramayana is long-life giving. A narrative by reading which a human will be blessed with sons and grandsons, and after enjoying worldly
comforts with attendants, will be adored in heaven after demise... 
[1-1-99]

"By reading this Ramayana, that person if a Brahmana obtains excellency in speech, if a Kshatriya obtains land-lordship, if Vaisya
attains profit in trade and even if a Sudra attains excellence." Thus Sage Narada gave a gist of Ramayana 
to Sage-poet Valmiki. [1-1-100]

In the first chapter of Bala Kanda the gist of Ramayana is imbibed and it is called <em>saMkShepa raamaayaNa,</em> 
or also called <em>baala raamaayaNa</em> . The youngsters are asked to recite these stanzas daily for 
longevity and a perfect personality like that of Rama. The summarised stanzas reflected here are from 
the main epic. The canto-wise summarisation is as below:
1. Bala Kanda [Book I] verses I-1-8 to 18<br>2. Ayodhyaa Kaanda [Book II ] verses I-1-18 to 28<br>
3. Aranya Kaanda [Book III] verses I-1-29 to 57<br>4. Kishkindhaa Kaanda [Book IV] I-1-58 to 71<br>5. Sundara 
Kaanda [Book V] I-1-72 to 78<br>6. Yuddha Kaanda [Book VI] I-1-79 to 90<br>7. Uttara Ramayana [Book VII] 
I-1-91 to 97<br>8. Phala Shruti [Results of Recitation] I-1-98 to 100
